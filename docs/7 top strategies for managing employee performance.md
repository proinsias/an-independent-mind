# 7 top strategies for managing employee performance

## Quotes

Employee performance management includes setting clear \[specific, challenging\] goals, developing an action plan to achieve those goals, and providing \[and feedback on progress\] support along the way.

Effective employee performance management has a variety of benefits, both at the individual and organizational levels:

-   It improves employee retention.
-   It gives employees direction and helps them hit their goals.
-   It drives results.

Here are seven essential tips for building an effective employee performance management strategy.

1. \[Establish a baseline of where your employee is today\]
2. Deliver ongoing feedback.
    1. \[This\] keeps your employees in the loop about what they need to work on in real time, which can help avoid any potential misunderstandings or surprises come review time.
3. Follow-up on (and measure) action items.
    1. If a manager simply tells an employee to improve — but that is never followed-up on — then it won't occur.
    2. Hold them accountable for addressing any skill gaps.
4. Avoid "performance micromanagement."
    1. Employees don't want you to 'manage' their performance; they want to be inspired, supported, and developed to make a bigger impact.
    2. While it's important to give your team the support and oversight they need to hit their performance goals, it's also necessary to give them the space and autonomy to hit those goals in their own way.
5. Help your team see the bigger picture.
    1. \[The\] areas you think they can improve and help them develop a plan to make those improvements \[is\] the *how*. \[The\] reason to improve, a strong *why*, that's going to inspire them to make the changes necessary to perform at a higher level.
    2. Help people understand the purpose and meaning in their work.
    3. Linking day-to-day tasks to a vision or goal that is bigger than themselves helps to create aspirational thinking and a sense of belonging and drive improvement.
6. Build on wins.
    1. Work with them to highlight their achievement — and on how to spread that success across all areas of their role.
7. Use the right tools.
