## Quotes

> Don't practice until you get it right. Practice until you don't get it wrong.

> Integrity means doing the right thing even when it's not convenient.

> We need to try to do the right thing every time, to perform at our best, because we never know which moment in our lives we'll be judged on.

> Despair, after all, is simply another form of denial.

> The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, answered "Man! Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.”
