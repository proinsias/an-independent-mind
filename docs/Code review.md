# Code review

## The point of code review

* To catch bugs
* To enforce norms
* To evolve norms


## Effective pull requests

* Discuss the overall technical approach before coding, not after. 
* Don’t couple dev tasks 1-to-1 with pull requests. It’s OK to split development of a feature across multiple pull requests. It’s also OK to create pull requests that aren’t associated with a specific task.
* Use a naming convention to explicitly categorize your code review feedback. The PR submitter should know which code review comments are calling out must-fix issues, and which are simply stylistic feedback, without ambiguity.
* Use tooling and conventions to reduce tedious arguments. 
* Don't just focus on line-by-line, relatively minor issues. Make sure to spend time on the big pictu much more serious design or architectural problems in the PR.
