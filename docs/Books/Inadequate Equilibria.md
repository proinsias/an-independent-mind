## Highlights
The Dunning-Kruger effect shows that unskilled individuals often rate their own skill very highly. — location: [81](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=81) ^ref-42559

Wouldn’t it be more prudent to remind ourselves of the base rate—the prior probability of 50% that we are below average? — location: [86](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=86) ^ref-22802

---
Finney notes that the average person’s opinions would be more accurate (on average) if they simply deferred to the most popular position on as many issues as they could. — location: [88](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=88) ^ref-63301

My view is that this is best done from a framework of incentives and the equilibria of those incentives—which — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=241) ^ref-8004

This price is an “is” statement rather than an “ought” statement, an observation and not a wish. In particular, an efficient market, from an economist’s perspective, is just one whose average price movement can’t be predicted by you. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=275) ^ref-27764

---
What people hear when you talk about “efficient prices” is that a cold-blooded machine has determined that some people ought to be paid $9/hour. And they hear the economist saying nice things about the machine, praising it as “efficient,” implying that the machine is right about this $9/hour price being good for society, that this price well reflects what someone’s efforts are justly worth. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=297) ^ref-12511

So a frothy housing market may see many overpriced houses, but few underpriced ones. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=341) ^ref-7507

Thus it will be easy to lose money in this market by buying stupidly, and much harder to make money by buying cleverly. The market prices will be inefficient—in a certain sense stupid—but they will not be exploitable. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=341) ^ref-42576

One systemic problem can often be overcome by one altruist in the right place. Two systemic problems are another matter entirely. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=435) ^ref-56390

Usually when we find trillion-dollar bills lying on the ground in real life, it’s a symptom of (1) a central-command bottleneck that nobody else is allowed to fix, as with the European Central Bank wrecking Europe, or (2) a system with enough moving parts that at least two parts are simultaneously broken, — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=436) ^ref-1847

---
meaning that single actors cannot defy the system. To modify an old aphorism: usually, when things suck, it’s because they suck in a way that’s a Nash equilibrium. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=438) ^ref-1290

---
In the same way that inefficient markets tend systematically to be inexploitable, grossly inadequate systems tend systematically to be unfixable by individual non-billionaires. — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=439) ^ref-8229

---
So inadequacy is even more important than exploitability on a day-to-day basis, because it’s inadequacy-generating situations that lead to low-hanging fruits large enough to be worthwhile at the individual level. — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=442) ^ref-31742

---
Indeed, if the system gave priority to rewarding better performance along the most useful or socially beneficial dimensions over all competing ways of feeding, the system wouldn’t be inadequate in the first place. It’s like wishing PredictIt didn’t have fees and betting limits so that you could snap up those mispriced contracts. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=468) ^ref-4613

---
because when something like this doesn’t get done, there’s usually a deeper reason than “nobody thought of it.” — location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=519) ^ref-4007

---
Even if nobody did think of it, that says something about a lack of incentives to be creative. — location: [520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076Z64CPG&location=520) ^ref-52229
