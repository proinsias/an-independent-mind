## Highlights

emblematic of an abdication of public responsibility to maintain the health of our political-economic system at a time when a comparative few at the top have more power over it than at any other time in more than a century. — location: [89](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=89) ^ref-3587

---

a big part of those jobs is siphoning off the gains of the economy for the benefit of a few at the top. — location: [93](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=93) ^ref-4241

---

the fault lies in their unwillingness to buck these incentives in order to change the system — location: [96](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=96) ^ref-13452

---

"If solutions within the system are so impossible to find, then maybe we should change the system itself," — location: [107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=107) ^ref-7079

---

First, forget politics as you've come to see it, as electoral contests between Democrats and Republicans. Think power. The underlying contest is between a small minority who have gained power over the system and the vast majority who have little or none. — location: [121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=121) ^ref-37115

---

Forget what you may have learned about the choice between the "free market" and government. — location: [124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=124) ^ref-37373

---

whom the market has been organized to serve. — location: [126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=126) ^ref-29759

---

Corporations won't voluntarily sacrifice shareholder returns unless laws require them to do so. — location: [128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=128) ^ref-57188

---

Don't assume that we're locked in a battle between capitalism and socialism. We already have socialism—for the very rich. Most Americans are subject to harsh capitalism. — location: [131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=131) ^ref-30598

---

Real national competitiveness lies in the productivity of the American people—which depends on their education, health, and the infrastructure that links them together. — location: [134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=134) ^ref-21799

---

Focus instead on systemic changes that have caused the wealth and power of a few to dramatically increase during the last forty years at the expense of the many. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=135) ^ref-4435

---

Forget the old idea that corporations succeed by becoming better, cheaper, or faster than their competitors. They now succeed mainly by increasing their monopoly power. — location: [137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=137) ^ref-12247

---

"If everyone is guilty then no one is to blame. And someone is to blame. Some people—some companies and some decision-makers in particular—have known exactly what priceless values they are sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money." — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=160) ^ref-25407

---

Today the great divide is not between left and right. It's between democracy and oligarchy. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=175) ^ref-1821

---

The only other country with similarly high levels of wealth concentration is Russia. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=203) ^ref-61960

---

the average American now has no effect on public policy. — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=205) ^ref-16772

---

None of it has reallocated power in the system or changed the rules of the game. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=343) ^ref-54777

---

In this age of oligarchy, no one should be surprised at this except those who stubbornly cling to the fiction of a free market divorced from politics and power. — location: [366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=366) ^ref-46044

---

the last four decades have revealed an almost total disconnect between the growth and competitiveness of large American corporations and the well-being of most Americans. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=422) ^ref-38083

---

worker representatives on their boards, mandating that workers receive a certain percentage of shares of stock, requiring large companies to provide medical benefits even for part-time workers, forcing corporations to recognize a union when a majority of workers want one, and giving communities where they operate a say on whether corporations that have been their mainstays should be able to abandon them. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=438) ^ref-52835

---

To the conservative mind, socialism means getting something for doing nothing. This pretty much describes Adam Neumann, the young, charismatic billionaire founder of WeWork, an office-sharing start-up. — location: [568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=568) ^ref-65065

---

Corporations do not automatically obey laws. They weigh the size of the penalty relative to the gain from law breaking. — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=631) ^ref-11845

---

"The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy." — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=643) ^ref-60778

---

Grassroots membership organizations have wilted because Americans have had less time for them. — location: [658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=658) ^ref-47808

---

"the same old Republican formula: privatize the gain, nationalize the risk. You succeed, it's in your pocket. You fail, the taxpayer pays the bill. It's just not right." — location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=732) ^ref-11047

---

History will show that the CEOs of America's largest corporations had the power to constrain the most dangerous, divisive, and anti-democratic president ever to occupy the Oval Office, but they chose not to use that power. One explanation for their complicity is that Trump's divisiveness is politically helpful to them. It keeps Americans fighting each other rather than discovering their common interest in fighting oligarchy. Another explanation can be found by following the money. Trump's tax cuts and frenzy of deregulation have caused corporate profits to soar. — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=848) ^ref-40624

---

Considering taxes and transfer payments, middle-class workers in Canada and much of Western Europe are better off than in the United States. — location: [929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=929) ^ref-29189

---

Most other advanced nations have parliamentary systems in which average workers are represented by at least one party that specifically advocates for them. — location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=936) ^ref-9906

---

JPMorgan doesn't care where it makes money. Its profits don't directly depend on the well-being of Americans. — location: [953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=953) ^ref-62876

---

The real competitiveness of the United States depends on only one thing: the productivity of Americans. — location: [977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=977) ^ref-51909

---

That in turn depends on our education, our health, and the infrastructure that connects us. — location: [977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=977) ^ref-2497

---

The American workforce, unfortunately, is hobbled by deteriorating schools, unaffordable college tuition, decaying infrastructure, soaring health-care costs, and diminishing basic research. — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=978) ^ref-60522

---

Global companies will create good, high-wage jobs in the United States only if Americans are productive enough and clever enough to summon them. Yet global companies won't make the necessary investments in American productivity, nor will they pay taxes to do so, because their allegiance is to their shareholders and not to Americans. — location: [984](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=984) ^ref-48031

---

as if American competitiveness were synonymous with the profits of American-headquartered corporations. — location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1004) ^ref-57833

---

it is folly to count on American corporations and their CEOs to voluntarily create good American jobs, raise the productivity and wages of American workers, and make America the leader of the industries of the future. — location: [1031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1031) ^ref-19306

---

They have siphoned off economic gains that otherwise would have gone to the bottom 90 percent. — location: [1044](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1044) ^ref-54168

---

that we work and live in a free market that is neutral and natural—existing outside government, unaffected by how power is allocated in the system. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1046) ^ref-39717

---

This is bunk. — location: [1055](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1055) ^ref-16566

---

These rules do not exist in nature. They are human creations. Governments don't intrude on free markets. Governments organize and maintain markets. The system is created by people. The question is, Which people? — location: [1060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1060) ^ref-9729

---

Yet vicious cycles have been reversed before. In the early twentieth century, progressives reclaimed our economy and democracy from the robber barons of the first Gilded Age. — location: [1085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1085) ^ref-53729

---

The progressive era welled up because millions of Americans saw that wealth and power at the top were undermining American democracy and stacking the economic deck. — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1090) ^ref-9510

---

Three big systemic changes over the last forty years have reallocated power upward in the system. They are (1) the shift in corporate governance from stakeholder to shareholder capitalism, (2) the shift in bargaining power from large unions to giant corporations, and (3) the unleashing of the financial power of Wall Street. — location: [1093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1093) ^ref-14564

---

CEOs began to devote themselves entirely and obsessively to maximizing the short-term values of their shares of stock in order to prevent a takeover. — location: [1137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1137) ^ref-12543

Before Icahn and the corporate raiders, it was assumed that large corporations had responsibilities to all their stakeholders, not just their shareholders. — location: [1138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1138) ^ref-11881

---

But starting in the 1980s, as a result of the takeovers mounted by Icahn and a few other raiders such as Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, a wholly different understanding about the purpose of the corporation emerged. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1162) ^ref-24672

Raiders targeted companies that could deliver higher returns to shareholders mainly by abandoning their other stakeholders—increasing — location: [1164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1164) ^ref-63240

---

raiders' tactics might easily have been seen to violate the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 because of their reliance on risky loans, Reagan's Securities and Exchange Commission made no attempt to stop them. — location: [1198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1198) ^ref-10146

Years before, the economist Milton Friedman had urged CEOs to give up stakeholder capitalism. — location: [1209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1209) ^ref-5564

He overlooked those who would bear the burden of the changes he pushed for. — location: [1217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1217) ^ref-18547

---

The costs of these maneuvers and of the obsession with maximizing share values, however, have been borne by workers who have been sacked or whose paychecks have stagnated and whose benefits have been cut and by the communities that have been left behind. — location: [1219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1219) ^ref-53141

---

The academic conceit that workers are simply "resources" that will move to "higher valued uses" has proven to be crushingly and cruelly naïve. Human beings are not like financial resources. They do not move easily or seamlessly to different jobs and other places. They are rooted in families and communities. They have particular skills, established routines, abiding understanding of positions and roles. They depend on some degree of security, predictability, and stability. They want to be respected and valued. When "efficiency" gains go to a comparatively few people at the top, while the costs and burdens are borne by many others—as has been the case since the 1980s—the common good is not improved. It is cast to the winds. — location: [1222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1222) ^ref-55507

---

This has been a boon to shareholders, especially the richest 1 percent of Americans, who own 40 percent of all shares of stock, and the richest 10 percent, who own 80 percent. — location: [1227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1227) ^ref-8638

All Americans are stakeholders in the American economy. — location: [1236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1236) ^ref-29089

The community itself may have invested in roads and other infrastructure to accommodate the corporation. — location: [1237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1237) ^ref-55974

without easing the often difficult transitions that followed—without providing workers with severance payments, job retraining, job search assistance, job counseling, help in selling homes the values of which predictably dropped when businesses left town, — location: [1240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1240) ^ref-37001

or help moving to where jobs existed; without aiding affected communities that were being jettisoned, or seeking to attract other businesses to make up for their losses of jobs and tax revenue, or finding other uses for the abandoned infrastructure of schools, roads, pipes, and real estate; without giving workers and communities sufficient advance notice so they could plan their own transitions. — location: [1241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1241) ^ref-41622

the easiest way to obtain them was to increase the bargaining power of corporations and reduce the bargaining power of workers. — location: [1250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1250) ^ref-872

It has been a direct transfer: A steadily larger portion of corporate revenues have been siphoned off into profits and a shrinking portion to wages. — location: [1254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1254) ^ref-44517

---

All this consolidation has inflated corporate profits, suppressed worker pay, supercharged economic inequality, and stifled innovation. — location: [1268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1268) ^ref-12969

The financial returns on political investments are among the highest in the whole system. — location: [1279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07Y7K7LJW&location=1279) ^ref-10905
