Computing is terrible. People think—falsely—that there's been something like Darwinian processes generating the present. So therefore what we have now must be better than anything that had been done before. And they don't realize that Darwinian processes, as any biologist will tell you, have nothing to do with optimization. They have to do with fitness. If you have a stupid environment you are going to get a stupid fit. — location: [2452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0769XXGXX&location=2452) ^ref-12093

There are three archetypes that are essential for invention. The dreamer, the first person who thinks of an idea. The engineer who reduces the idea to a prototype. And then the entrepreneur who takes that one prototype and works out the marketing, financing, and business model to make thousands or millions of them. Jaron was the entrepreneur. — location: [3081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0769XXGXX&location=3081) ^ref-52995

The skills we need most in today's world—skills like empathy, creativity, taking initiative, and cross-disciplinary thinking—are all things that machines will never have.

can we talk about enhanced intelligence or computer-augmented intelligence, where the human being isn't replaced in the equation?" The people who are working on artificial intelligence are looking at how they can take a repetitive menial task and make a computer do it faster and better. To me, that's a much less threatening notion than creating an artificially intelligent being. — location: [7968](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0769XXGXX&location=7968) ^ref-45979

Economics is based on a certain number of people dying every once in a while, right? Well, that's not going to happen, which is going to mess up everything. Fusion power is going to mess up a number of things. — location: [8136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0769XXGXX&location=8136) ^ref-13604
