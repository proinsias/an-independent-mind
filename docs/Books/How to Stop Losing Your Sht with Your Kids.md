by [[Carla Naumburg]]

## Summary

<!--The Book in 3 Sentences. No more than a couple paragraphs summarizing this BOOK -->

## Quotes

> Much of parenting is based on trust, which is an especially tricky issue for kids. They're wired to trust their parents and caregivers because we're the ones who are supposed to keep then safe. As a result, when we lose our shit with them, they tend to blame themselves because that's easier than questioning or doubting the person who keeps them alive and runs their lives. Over time, our kids may learn to not only tolerate and expect bad behavior in others but to also blame themselves for it.

> We can't control anyone else's behavior - we can only control our own.

> Telling yourself that the reason you keep exploding is because you're a bad parent or you have a bad kid is an unhelpful story because it doesn't offer any options for change and growth.

> You're doing an incredibly hard job, and you're doing it without the right information, support, resources, and rest. When we do something really hard every single day without you're doing it without the right information, support, resources, and those things, we lose it. It's the human way. We are literally wired to freak out when our buttons are repeatedly pushed.

> There's no reason to blame yourself for your temper, but it's time to step up and make some changes.

> Our cultural obsession with happiness has created the false delusion that life should be easy and that we should be happy most, not all, of the time.

> If parenting and life are feeling particularly challenging for any reason, it's not always because you're doing something wrong. It's because hard is part of the deal for everyone, no matter how good they make it look on Instagram.

> The painful truth that no one wants to talk about is that some kids are just harder to parent.

> Most parents suck at taking care of themselves.

> Runners who know they haven't been able to properly prepare their bodies lower their expectations and cut themselves some slack when the race doesn't go as well as they had hoped.

> Fatigue makes it harder to think clearly, solve even the most basic problems, focus our attention, manage our emotions, make good choices, and stay healthy.

> There is great comfort in the knowledge that if we're making poor parenting choices, at least we're doing it together.

> All that advice creates the illusion that we can fix any parenting problem that comes our way, even though some of the most common problems just aren't fixable.

> We parents have been led to believe that it's our job to ensure our children's happiness.

> But when it doesn't work, we end up thinking we've failed at parenting rather than realizing that the advice has failed us.

> Taking responsibility for shit that's not your fault is what parenting is all about.
