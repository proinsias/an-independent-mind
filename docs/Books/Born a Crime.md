## Highlights

The thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her. No one chose her. She did it on her own. She found her way through sheer force of will. — location: [1058](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1058) ^ref-46494

every child is born the center of its own universe, incapable of understanding the world beyond its own wants and needs, — location: [1089](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1089) ^ref-63827

What was ironic to me was that white people had spent years seeing video of black people being beaten to death by other white people, but this one video of a black man kicking a cat, that’s what sent them over the edge. — location: [1314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1314) ^ref-20325

the family had to make a decision. Do they give up their white status to go and live as colored people in a colored area? Or would they split up, the mother taking the colored child to live in the ghetto while the father stayed white to make a living to support them? — location: [1604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=1604) ^ref-10636

The first thing I learned about having money was that it gives you choices. People don’t want to be rich. They want to be able to choose. The richer you are, the more choices you have. That is the freedom of money. — location: [2431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2431) ^ref-30817

People love to say, “Give a man a fish, and he’ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he’ll eat for a lifetime.” What they don’t say is, “And it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod.” That’s the part of the analogy that’s missing. — location: [2464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2464) ^ref-29596

Holocaust victims count because Hitler counted them. — location: [2550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2550) ^ref-20219

The hood made me realize that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn’t do: crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime doesn’t discriminate. — location: [2722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2722) ^ref-4693

Because by making the choice to leave, you’re insulting the place that raised you and made you and never turned you away. And that place fights you back. — location: [2891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DHWACVY&location=2891) ^ref-52534
