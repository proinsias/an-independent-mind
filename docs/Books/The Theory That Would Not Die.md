## Highlights
By rights, Bayes’ rule should be named for someone else: a Frenchman, Pierre Simon Laplace, one of the most powerful mathematicians and scientists in history. — location: [76](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=76) ^ref-52713

---
At its heart, Bayes runs counter to the deeply held conviction that modern science requires objectivity and precision. Bayes is a measure of belief. And it says that we can learn even from missing and inadequate data, from approximations, and from ignorance. — location: [93](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=93) ^ref-16646

---
the likelihood is the probability of competing hypotheses for the fixed data that have been observed. — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=241) ^ref-44472

---
By modern standards, we should refer to the Bayes-Price rule. — location: [302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=302) ^ref-54115

---
on the one person capable of doing something about it, the great French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=320) ^ref-42122

---
the metric reform to standardize weights and measures. It was Laplace who named the meter, centimeter, and millimeter. — location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=629) ^ref-59040

---
The probability of causes was still useful in particularly uncertain cases because it was more powerful than frequentism. — location: [667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=667) ^ref-5134

---
dealing with trustworthy data was easier with frequentism. — location: [668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=668) ^ref-55408

---
Mathematicians did not learn until the midtwentieth century that, even with great amounts of data, the two methods can sometimes seriously disagree. — location: [669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=669) ^ref-51892

---
Undergraduates today study Laplace’s first version of the equation, which deals with discrete events such as coin tosses and births. Advanced and graduate students and researchers use calculus with his later equation to work with observations on a continuous range between two values, — location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=679) ^ref-38332

Bayes-Price-Laplace. — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=688) ^ref-15496

---
They identified Bayes’ rule with equal priors and damned the entire rule because of them. Few of the critics tried to even imagine other kinds of priors. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=768) ^ref-3536

He said he qualified for the astronomy department “because Earth is a planet.” — location: [1101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1101) ^ref-41231

---
Moreover, the p-value is a statement about data, whereas Jeffreys wanted to know about his hypothesis given his data. — location: [1147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1147) ^ref-61498

---
Jeffreys concluded that p-values fundamentally distorted science. Frequentists, he complained, “appear to regard observations as a basis for possibly rejecting hypotheses, but in no case for supporting them.”52 But odds are that at least some of the hypotheses Fisher rejected were worth investigating or were actually true. — location: [1154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1154) ^ref-34677

Britain was self-sufficient in little other than coal; it grew enough food to feed only one in three residents. — location: [1207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1207) ^ref-25048

---
Bletchley Park clerks catalogued by hand 17,000 ways “ein” could be encrypted, and a special machine was constructed to screen for them. — location: [1322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1322) ^ref-55827

---
To capture a codebook, Lt. Cmdr. Ian Fleming, the future creator of James Bond but at the time an aide to the head of Britain’s Directorate of Naval Intelligence, concocted Operation Ruthless. — location: [1392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1392) ^ref-31080

---
the purpose of information is to reduce uncertainty while the purpose of encryption is to increase it. — location: [1506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1506) ^ref-13177

---
He later estimated that Bletchley Park’s decoders had shortened the war in Europe by at least two years. — location: [1604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1604) ^ref-50719

combining two concepts: utility (the quantification of reward) and probability (the quantification of uncertainty). — location: [1958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1958) ^ref-45393

---
as the amount of data increases, subjectivists move into agreement, the way scientists come to a consensus as evidence accumulates — location: [1961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1961) ^ref-5834

---
When they have little data, scientists disagree and are subjectivists; when they have piles of data, they agree and become objectivists. — location: [1963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1963) ^ref-41798

work with isolated one-time events, such as the probability that a chair weighs 20 pounds, that a plane would be late, or that the United States would be at war in five years. — location: [1990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1990) ^ref-60891

---
Bayesians could also combine information from different sources, treat observables as random variables, and assign probabilities to all of them, whether they formed a bell-shaped curve or some other shape. Bayesians used all their available data because each fact could change the answer by a small amount. — location: [1992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1992) ^ref-26889

---
Probability came very late into civilization . . . [and many scientists find it] rather disturbing because it’s not a process of discovery. It’s more a process of interpretation.” — location: [1999](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=1999) ^ref-65521

---
It implies that sufficiently good data will bring previously disparate observers to agreement. — location: [2004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=2004) ^ref-11530

Mosteller noted that a single measurement by an astronaut on the moon would be enough to overwhelm any expert’s prior opinion about the depth of the dust on the lunar surface. — location: [2997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=2997) ^ref-44503

---
“Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.” — location: [3152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=3152) ^ref-13015

“Bayes says that the longer you search without finding the target, the worse your prospects are, because the remaining time to detect the target gets longer, not shorter.” — location: [3745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=3745) ^ref-30911

---
On the other hand, those with confidence in Bayes’ rule could trace their progress. “Areas that you search go down in probability,” — location: [3747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=3747) ^ref-17931

---
“and areas that you haven’t searched go up. — location: [3748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=3748) ^ref-50918

Frequency-based statistics worked well when one hypothesis was a special case of the other and both assumed gradual behavior. — location: [3981](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=3981) ^ref-10700

---
But when hypotheses were competing and neither was a special case of the other, frequentism was not as helpful, especially with data involving abrupt changes—like the formation of a militant union. — location: [3982](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0050QB3EQ&location=3982) ^ref-57881
