## Highlights
All matter is composed of a harmonic chord of frequencies that combine together to form a stable packet. You can think of it as a three-dimensional standing wave that compresses the underlying fabric of our universe into a tight little vibrating bundle. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0184ZLSMG&location=261) ^ref-31408

---
Some of these wave packets are not completely harmonic and try to dispel the destabilizing frequencies, giving them off as radiation as the packet attempts to achieve a harmonious chord. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0184ZLSMG&location=263) ^ref-25658
