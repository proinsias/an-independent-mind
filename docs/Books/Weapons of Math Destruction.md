# Weapons of Math Destruction

by [[Cathy O'Neil]]

## Summary


## Quotes

> In Weapons of Math Destruction, many poisonous assumptions are camouflaged by math and go largely untested and unquestioned.

> Models are opinions embedded in mathematics.

> \[Racism\] is powered by haphazard data gathering and spurious correlations, reinforced by institutional inequities and polluted by confirmation bias.

> Justice cannot just be something that one part of society inflicts on another.
