## Highlights
To tag this distinction with philosophical buzzwords, in statistical mechanics the probability distribution is an epistemic notion—describing the state of our knowledge—rather than an ontological one—describing some objective feature of reality. Epistemology is the study of knowledge; ontology is the study of what is real. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=492) ^ref-484

---
Our observations aren’t revealing pre-existing facts of which we were previously ignorant; at best, they reveal a tiny slice of a much bigger, fundamentally elusive reality. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=556) ^ref-13636

---
particles and fields. Particles are point-like objects at a definite location in space, while fields (like the gravitational field) are spread throughout space, taking on a particular value at every point. — location: [692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=692) ^ref-39269

---
If ordinary matter made of atoms only lasted for that long, someone would have noticed by now. — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=848) ^ref-8849

---
The essentially “quantum” nature of the subatomic world, in this picture, comes about not because reality is actually subdivided into distinct chunks but because there are natural vibrational modes for the waves out of which physical systems are made. — location: [951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=951) ^ref-21862

---
The word “quantum,” referring to some definite amount of stuff, can give the impression that quantum mechanics describes a world that is fundamentally discrete and pixelated, like when you zoom in closely on a computer monitor or TV screen. It’s actually the opposite; quantum mechanics describes the world as a smooth wave function. — location: [954](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=954) ^ref-50955

---
But in the right circumstances, where individual parts of the wave function are tied down in a certain way, the wave takes the form of a combination of distinct vibrational — location: [957](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=957) ^ref-39274

---
modes. When we observe such a system, we see those discrete possibilities. That’s true for orbits of electrons, and it will also explain why quantum fields look like sets of individual particles. In quantum mechanics, the world is fundamentally wavy; its apparent quantum discreteness comes from the particular way those waves are able to vibrate. — location: [958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=958) ^ref-51941

---
It’s not that we can’t know position and momentum, it’s that they don’t even exist at the same time. — location: [1061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1061) ^ref-35604

---
That’s the uncertainty principle. It’s not that we can’t know both quantities at the — location: [1103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1103) ^ref-18785

---
same time; it’s just a fact about how wave functions work that if position is concentrated near some location, momentum is completely undetermined, and vice versa. — location: [1104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1104) ^ref-33093

---
The uncertainty principle is a statement about the nature of quantum states and their relationship to observable quantities, not a statement about the physical act of measurement. — location: [1112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1112) ^ref-65454

---
The electrons passing through the slits are described by a wave function, which just like our classical wave will go through both slits and oscillate up and down, and therefore it makes sense that we see interference patterns. Then when they hit the screen they are being observed, and it’s at that point they appear to us as particles. — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1180) ^ref-45082

---
The double-slit experiment makes it difficult to cling to the belief that the electron is just a single classical point, and the wave function simply represents our ignorance about where that point is. Ignorance doesn’t cause interference patterns. There is something real about the wave function. — location: [1194](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1194) ^ref-48255

---
It’s natural to think of spin-up and spin-down as pointing in opposite directions. I mean, just look at the arrows. But as quantum states, they are perpendicular to each other: — location: [1268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1268) ^ref-3885

---
The trick is to think of every point in space as defining a different component, and the wave function is a superposition of all of them. — location: [1271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1271) ^ref-9717

---
For a single spin, the uncertainty principle says that the state can’t have a definite value for the spin along the original axes (up/down) and the rotated axes (right/left) at the same time. — location: [1312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1312) ^ref-48290

---
The uncertainty principle reflects the relationship between what really exists (quantum states) and what we can measure (one observable at a time). — location: [1317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1317) ^ref-55719

---
Every non-Everettian version of quantum mechanics is, as physicist Ted Bunn has put it, a “disappearing worlds” theory. — location: [1664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=1664) ^ref-41661

---
Decoherence makes it fantastically unlikely for one world to interfere with another, but not metaphysically impossible. — location: [2234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2234) ^ref-54119

---
where the Schrödinger equation is completely reversible. — location: [2258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2258) ^ref-39605

---
it’s improbable that entropy would ever go down. — location: [2263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2263) ^ref-8630

---
Entropy is related to our ignorance. If a system has low entropy, there are relatively few microscopic configurations that would look that way, so we know a lot about it just from its macroscopically observable features; if it has high entropy, we know relatively little. — location: [2279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2279) ^ref-14295

---
The fact that wave functions only branch forward in time and not backward is not simply reminiscent of the fact that entropy increases—it’s the same fact. The low entropy of the early universe corresponds to the idea that there were many unentangled subsystems back then. — location: [2290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2290) ^ref-41292

---
Does that mean that it’s possible that decoherence will someday reverse, and worlds actually will fuse together rather than branching apart?” — location: [2297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2297) ^ref-19767

---
With the wisdom of accumulated years, we can see that the subjective nature of Boltzmann’s definition does not stop it from being a useful one, and the fact that the second law is a really good approximation rather than an absolute unbreakable law is more than good enough for whatever purposes we may have.” — location: [2319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2319) ^ref-55733

---
Some things don’t happen, because the Schrödinger equation never leads to them happening. — location: [2406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2406) ^ref-64511

---
It is a perfectly realist account that doesn’t invoke any fuzzy notions about consciousness in its explanation of experimental outcomes. — location: [2647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2647) ^ref-43697

---
You test theories in comparison to other theories, — location: [2657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2657) ^ref-11033

---
We see particles when we look closely enough at vibrating fields, simply because those fields obey the rules of quantum mechanics. — location: [2664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2664) ^ref-31862

---
The fact that amplitudes can be negative allows for the interference that we see in the double-slit experiment, for example. — location: [2702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=2702) ^ref-30921

---
A decision, on the other hand, is a purely macroscopic phenomenon. — location: [3105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3105) ^ref-43792

---
branching. But we can still ask whether there are other branches where you made different decisions. And indeed there might be, but the right way to think about the causality is “some microscopic process happened that caused branching, and on different branches you ended up making different decisions,” rather than “you made a decision, which caused the wave function of the universe to branch.” — location: [3112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3112) ^ref-37654

---
But it’s not my decision that’s causing the branching; it’s the branching that I interpret as leading to my decision. — location: [3135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3135) ^ref-22007

---
Similarly, quantum mechanics has nothing to do with the question of free will. — location: [3141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3141) ^ref-784

---
One important insight was to think of the basic building blocks of nature not as particles but as fields pervading space, thus leading to quantum field theory. — location: [3295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3295) ^ref-2545

---
even the particles that we know and love are actually vibrations in fields that suffuse the space around us. — location: [3298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3298) ^ref-1303

---
In other words, we have a theory of quantum gravity that is adequate when gravity is fairly weak, one that is perfectly capable of describing why apples fall from trees or how the moon orbits the Earth. But it’s limited; once gravity becomes very strong, or we try to push our calculations too far, our theoretical apparatus fails us. — location: [3310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3310) ^ref-41117

---
These are typically derived from our experience with the classical limit of the theory under consideration, — location: [3329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3329) ^ref-47233

---
That’s emergence: a way of capturing important features of a system using far less information than an exhaustive description would entail.* — location: [3407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3407) ^ref-64838

---
the existence of an accurate model of the system that requires only a tiny fraction of the full information characterizing it. — location: [3412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3412) ^ref-1558

---
The feature that makes space special is locality. Interactions between different objects happen when they are nearby in space. — location: [3457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3457) ^ref-19206

---
A wave function of a wave, if you like. — location: [3578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3578) ^ref-37275

---
A classical field is a function of space, and a classical theory with many fields would describe multiple functions of space overlapping with one another. The wave function in quantum field theory is not a function of space, it’s a function of the set of all configurations of all the classical fields. — location: [3591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3591) ^ref-64924

---
Anytime the wave function of a system is “tied down” by going to zero for large/faraway/extreme configurations, it will exhibit a set of discrete energy levels. — location: [3613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3613) ^ref-8857

---
What they mean is “the lowest-energy state of your quantum field theory.” — location: [3624](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3624) ^ref-52633

---
What you end up seeing is a localized vibration propagating in the field, leaving a track in an experimental detector just like a particle is supposed to do. — location: [3636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3636) ^ref-46500

---
the vacuum is the “lowest-energy state,” not necessarily a “zero-energy state.” In fact, its energy can be anything at all; it’s a constant of nature, a parameter of the universe that is not determined by any other set of measurable parameters. — location: [3664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3664) ^ref-13148

---
The number of particles we see isn’t an absolute reality, it depends on how we look at the state. — location: [3744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3744) ^ref-33745

---
The entropy is then a way of counting the number of ways those constituents can be arranged without changing the macroscopic appearance of the system. Entropy is related to ignorance: high-entropy states are those for which we don’t know much about the microscopic details of a system just from knowing its observable features. — location: [3953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=3953) ^ref-31437

---
The behavior of spacetime in general relativity can be thought of as simply the natural tendency of systems to move toward configurations of higher entropy. — location: [4010](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4010) ^ref-59328

---
the locality of physical interactions helps bring order to the universe. — location: [4053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4053) ^ref-21839

---
knowing the area of every possible surface in a region is enough to fully determine the geometry of that region; — location: [4072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4072) ^ref-24198

---
the route to understanding the universe lies not in quantizing gravity, but in finding gravity within quantum mechanics. — location: [4101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4101) ^ref-19095

---
A closed universe has exactly zero energy, regardless of what’s inside. — location: [4126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4126) ^ref-29473

---
time has emerged from a static state, thanks to the magic of entanglement. — location: [4147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4147) ^ref-36091

---
That corresponds to an entropy of 1090, which is greater than the entropy of all the known particles in the entire observable universe. — location: [4270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4270) ^ref-39262

---
they represent the highest-entropy states we can have in any given size region of space. — location: [4285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4285) ^ref-63913

---
gravity seems to change things around in an important way. It prevents most of those worlds from existing, because they would describe too much energy being packed into a local region. — location: [4305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4305) ^ref-15434

---
It’s not literally true that an electron — location: [4469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4469) ^ref-14042

---
and a positron change into a photon and then change back. For one thing, real photons move at the speed of light, while electron/positron pairs (either the individual particles or the center of mass of a pair of them) do not. — location: [4470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4470) ^ref-33055

---
What we mean by “virtual particles” are subtle distortions in the wave function of a collection of quantum fields. — location: [4485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4485) ^ref-53989

---
That’s the origin of the infamous infinities plaguing quantum field theory. — location: [4509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4509) ^ref-12831

---
Obviously the probability of a certain interaction can be at most 1, so an infinite answer means we’ve taken a wrong turn somehow. — location: [4510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4510) ^ref-61792

---
Feynman and others managed to work out a procedure for dealing with these infinities, now known as renormalization. — location: [4511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4511) ^ref-28197

---
In Feynman-diagram language, this means that even an isolated particle propagating through space is actually accompanied by a surrounding cloud of virtual particles. — location: [4516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4516) ^ref-60180

---
The infinities that you get by naïvely turning a crank in the Feynman diagrams are simply a result of trying to work with bare fields, whereas what we really observe are physical ones. — location: [4520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4520) ^ref-46852

---
Quantum field theory teaches us that the particles we see aren’t simple point-like objects; each particle is surrounded by a cloud of other virtual particles, or (more accurately) by the other quantum fields it interacts with. — location: [4527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4527) ^ref-48236

---
of the infinities in Feynman-diagram calculations came from virtual particles with very large energies, corresponding to processes at extremely short distances. — location: [4535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4535) ^ref-14583

---
But high energies and short distances are precisely where we should have the least confidence that we know what’s going on. — location: [4536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4536) ^ref-18484

---
Processes with very high energies could involve completely new fields, ones that have such high masses that we haven’t yet produced them in experiments. For that matter, spacetime itself might break down at short distances, perhaps at the Planck length. — location: [4537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=4537) ^ref-17087

It’s common for quotations to be reattributed to plausible speakers who are more famous than the actual source of the quote. Sociologist Robert Merton has dubbed this the Matthew Effect, after a line from the Gospel of Matthew: “For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” — location: [5848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NTYJJDX&location=5848) ^ref-16864
