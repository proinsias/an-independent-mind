## Highlights
Your DNA is simply an instruction manual for making you. A length of DNA is divided into segments called chromosomes and shorter individual units called genes. The sum of all your genes is the genome. — location: [224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=224) ^ref-56759

---
What genes specifically do is provide instructions for building proteins. — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=237) ^ref-56846

---
Most of the useful things in the body are proteins. Some speed up chemical changes and are known as enzymes. Others convey chemical messages and are known as hormones. Still others attack pathogens and are called antibodies. The largest of all our proteins is called titin, which helps to control muscle elasticity. — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=237) ^ref-41803

Every day, it has been estimated, between one and five of your cells turn cancerous, and your immune system captures and kills them. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=263) ^ref-49507

“People act as if skin color is a determinant of character when all it is is a reaction to sunlight. Biologically, there is actually no such thing as race—nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure, or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples. — location: [347](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=347) ^ref-24768

Its production slows dramatically as we age, which is why older people’s hair tends to turn gray. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=362) ^ref-42387

---
The red of sunburn is because the tiny blood vessels in the affected areas become engorged with blood, making the skin hot to the touch. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=380) ^ref-19086

We are actually as hairy as our cousins the apes. It’s just that our hair is much wispier and fainter. — location: [421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=421) ^ref-51650

known formally as horripilation but more commonly as getting goose bumps. In furry mammals, it adds a useful layer of insulating air between the hair and the skin, but in humans it has absolutely no physiological benefit — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=426) ^ref-16829

Hair on the head acts as a good insulator in cold weather and a good reflector of heat in hot weather. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=435) ^ref-43653

---
We each grow about twenty-five feet of hair in a lifetime, but because all hair falls out at some point, no single strand can ever get longer than about three feet. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=448) ^ref-28707

“The loss of most of our body hair and the gain of the ability to dissipate excess body heat through eccrine sweating helped to make possible the dramatic enlargement of our most temperature-sensitive organ, the brain.” That, she says, is how sweat helped to make you brainy. — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=489) ^ref-55098

Unlike the rest of the body, the palms don’t sweat in response to physical exertion or heat, but only from stress. — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=506) ^ref-20362

To make one’s hands safely clean after a medical examination requires thorough washing with soap and water for at least a full minute—a standard that is, in practical terms, all but unattainable for anyone dealing with lots of patients. — location: [518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=518) ^ref-20348

About 60 percent of men are “substantially bald” by the age of fifty. One man in five achieves that condition by thirty. — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=554) ^ref-41862

---
a hormone called dihydrotestosterone tends to go slightly haywire as we age, directing hair follicles on the head to shut down and more reserved ones in the nostrils and ears to spring to dismaying life. The one known cure for baldness is castration. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=556) ^ref-5757

A single parent bacterium could in theory produce a mass of offspring greater than the weight of Earth in less than two days. In three days, its progeny would exceed the mass of the observable universe. — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=590) ^ref-40775

the microbe heap would be twenty-five times greater than the animal one. Make no mistake. This is a planet of microbes. We are here at their pleasure. They don’t need us at all. We’d be dead in a day without them. — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=593) ^ref-25183

Colds unquestionably are more frequent in winter than in summer, but that may only be because we spend more time indoors then and are more exposed to others’ leakages and exhalations. — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=672) ^ref-56473

---
The common cold is not a single illness but rather a family of symptoms generated by a multiplicity of viruses, of which the most pernicious are the rhinoviruses. These alone come in a hundred varieties. — location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=673) ^ref-37929

In fact, at a cellular level, they aren’t very like plants at all. They don’t photosynthesize, so they have no chlorophyll and thus are not green. — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=695) ^ref-53105

To help us deal better with this fractional lag, the brain does a truly extraordinary thing: it continuously forecasts what the world will be like a fifth of a second from now, and that is what it gives us as the present. That means that we never see the world as it is at this very instant, but rather as it will be a fraction of a moment in the future. We spend our whole lives, in other words, living in a world that doesn’t quite exist yet. — location: [1009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1009) ^ref-52258

Now, however, it is thought that the stimulation was mostly providing the sensation of memory and that what the patients were experiencing was more like a hallucination than a recalled event. — location: [1087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1087) ^ref-9310

Although most of the growth of the brain occurs in the first two years and is 95 percent completed by the age of ten, the synapses aren’t fully wired until a young person is in his or her mid- to late twenties. — location: [1126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1126) ^ref-47737

Paradoxically, the very fact that the brain is so snugly encased in its protective skull leaves it susceptible to damage when it swells from infection or when fluid is added to it, — location: [1210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1210) ^ref-28775

To help protect us from the damage of really loud noises, we have something called an acoustic reflex, in which a muscle jerks the stapes away from the cochlea, essentially breaking the circuit, whenever a brutally intense sound is perceived, and it maintains that posture for some seconds afterward, which is why we are often deafened after an explosion. — location: [1504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1504) ^ref-13489

When loss of balance is prolonged or severe, the brain doesn’t know quite what to make of it and interprets it as poisoning. That is why loss of balance so generally results in nausea. — location: [1528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1528) ^ref-55045

When we smell something, the information, for reasons unknown, goes straight to the olfactory cortex, which is nestled close to the hippocampus, where memories are shaped, and it is thought by some neuroscientists that that may explain why certain odors are so powerfully evocative of memories for us. — location: [1573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1573) ^ref-13647

Curiously, the blood passing through the chambers of the heart does nothing for the heart itself. The oxygen that nourishes it arrives via the coronary arteries, in exactly the way oxygen reaches other organs. — location: [1956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1956) ^ref-30434

Clotting doesn’t work in the principal arteries, because the flow of blood is too fierce; any clot would be swept away, which is why major bleeds must be stopped with the pressure of a tourniquet. — location: [2179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2179) ^ref-55743

All blood cells are the same inside, but the outsides are covered with different kinds of antigens—that is, proteins that project outward from the cell surface—and that is what accounts for blood types. — location: [2266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2266) ^ref-50714

If our blood is red, incidentally, why do our veins look blue? It is simply a quirk of optics. When light lands on our skin, a higher proportion of the red spectrum is absorbed, but more of the blue light is bounced back, so blue is what we see.
