## Highlights
They include pessimism about the way the world is heading, cynicism about the institutions of modernity, and an inability to conceive of a higher purpose in anything other than religion. — location: [226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=226) ^ref-4701

---
reason tells you that none of this is particular to you, you have the responsibility to provide to others what you expect for yourself. — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=284) ^ref-36006

You can foster the welfare of other sentient beings by enhancing life, health, knowledge, freedom, abundance, safety, beauty, and peace. — location: [285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=285) ^ref-53051

---
History shows that when we sympathize with others and apply our ingenuity to improving the human condition, we can make progress in doing so, and you can help to continue that progress. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=286) ^ref-45308

“If old truths are to retain their hold on men’s minds, they must be restated in the language and concepts of successive generations” — location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=317) ^ref-48163

Optimism (in the sense that I have advocated) is the theory that all failures—all evils—are due to insufficient knowledge. — location: [339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=339) ^ref-6245

---
Some problems are hard, but it is a mistake to confuse hard problems with problems unlikely to be solved. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=341) ^ref-12191

the Enlightenment hope for progress was concentrated on human institutions. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=436) ^ref-43517

---
Cruel punishments, whether or not they are in some sense “deserved,” are no more effective at deterring harm than moderate but surer punishments, and they desensitize spectators and brutalize the society that implements them. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=448) ^ref-18628

---
Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an effective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them, and other people are more valuable to you alive than dead. — location: [463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=463) ^ref-24987

Now order could be characterized in terms of the set of all microscopically distinct states of a system (in the original example involving heat, the possible speeds and positions of all the molecules in the two bodies). Of all these states, the ones that we find useful from a bird’s-eye view (such as one body being hotter than the other, which translates into the average speed of the molecules in one body being higher than the average speed in the other) make up a tiny fraction of the possibilities, while all the disorderly or useless states (the ones without a temperature difference, in which the average speeds in the two bodies are the same) make up the vast majority. It follows that any perturbation of the system, whether it is a random jiggling of its parts or a whack from the outside, will, by the laws of probability, nudge the system toward disorder or uselessness—not because nature strives for disorder, but because there are so many more ways of being disorderly than of being orderly. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=497) ^ref-8382

Life and happiness depend on an infinitesimal sliver of orderly arrangements of matter amid the astronomical number of possibilities. — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=508) ^ref-50787

Some physicists enshrine information as one of the basic constituents of the universe, together with matter and energy. — location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=597) ^ref-6655

Not only does the universe not care about our desires, but in the natural course of events it will appear to thwart them, because there are so many more ways for things to go wrong than for them to go right. — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=688) ^ref-8578

We’d be wiser to negotiate a social contract that puts us in a positive-sum game: neither gets to harm the other, and both are encouraged to help the other. — location: [765](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=765) ^ref-39223

it is genuinely admirable for one individual to sacrifice his or her interests for those of many individuals. It’s quite another thing when a person is forced to make the supreme sacrifice for the benefit of a charismatic leader, a square of cloth, or colors on a map. — location: [817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=817) ^ref-27511

---
the left was sympathetic to nationalism when it was fused with Marxist liberation movements. And many on the left encourage identity politicians and social justice warriors who downplay individual rights in favor of equalizing the standing of races, classes, and genders, which they see as being pitted in zero-sum competition. — location: [823](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=823) ^ref-20314

---
Left-wing and right-wing political ideologies have themselves become secular religions, providing people with a community of like-minded brethren, a catechism of sacred beliefs, a well-populated demonology, and a beatific confidence in the righteousness of their cause. — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=840) ^ref-31266

It’s the idea of progress that rankles the chattering class—the Enlightenment belief that by understanding the world we can improve the human condition. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=914) ^ref-29024

how can we soundly appraise the state of the world? The answer is to count. — location: [996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=996) ^ref-47456

---
A quantitative mindset, despite its nerdy aura, is in fact the morally enlightened one, because it treats every human life as having equal value rather than privileging the people who are closest to us or most photogenic. — location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=998) ^ref-34502

---
Progress cannot always be monotonic because solutions to problems create new problems.18 But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn. — location: [1026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1026) ^ref-25084

---
If you ignore all the years in which an indicator of some problem declines, and report every uptick (since, after all, it’s “news”), readers will come away with the impression that life is getting worse and worse even as it gets better and better. — location: [1029](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1029) ^ref-12699

If you see that a pile of laundry has gone down, it does not mean the clothes washed themselves; it means someone washed the clothes. — location: [1048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1048) ^ref-45146

---
to look at data showing that violence has gone down and say “Violence has gone down” is to describe a fact. To look at data showing that violence has gone down and say “Violence has gone up” is to be delusional. To ignore data on violence and say “Violence has gone up” is to be a know-nothing. — location: [1053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1053) ^ref-33192

“The most important of all limitations on knowledge-creation is that we cannot prophesy: we cannot predict the content of ideas yet to be created, or their effects. This limitation is not only consistent with the unlimited growth of knowledge, it is entailed by it.” — location: [1069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1069) ^ref-2750

Two other illusions mislead us into thinking that things ain’t what they used to be: we mistake the growing burdens of maturity and parenthood for a less innocent world, and we mistake a decline in our own faculties for a decline in the times.25 As the columnist Franklin Pierce Adams pointed out, “Nothing is more responsible for the good old days than a bad memory.” — location: [1111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1111) ^ref-31412

The financial writer Morgan Housel has observed that while pessimists sound like they’re trying to help you, optimists sound like they’re trying to sell you something. — location: [1129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1129) ^ref-44936

As we care about more of humanity, we’re apt to mistake the harms around us for signs of how low the world has sunk rather than how high our standards have risen. — location: [1144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1144) ^ref-42920

---
One consequence is that many Americans today have difficulty imagining, valuing or even believing in the promise of incremental system change, which leads to a greater appetite for revolutionary, smash-the-machine change. — location: [1151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1151) ^ref-8324

unequal societies make people feel that they are pitted in a winner-take-all competition for dominance, and the stress makes them sick and self-destructive. — location: [2137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2137) ^ref-39138

Economic inequality, then, is not itself a dimension of human well-being, and it should not be confused with unfairness or with poverty. — location: [2179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2179) ^ref-24370

The United States is famously resistant to anything smacking of redistribution. Yet it allocates 19 percent of its GDP to social services, — location: [2293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2293) ^ref-14454

---
social spending in the United States is even higher than it appears, because many Americans are forced to pay for health, retirement, and disability benefits through their employers rather than the government. When this privately administered social spending is added to the public portion, the United States vaults from twenty-fourth into second place among the thirty-five OECD countries, just behind France. — location: [2296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2296) ^ref-28185

The elephant’s bulk (its body and head), which includes about seven-tenths of the world’s population, consists of the “emerging global middle class,” mainly in Asia. Over this period they saw cumulative gains of 40 to 60 percent in their real incomes. The nostrils at the tip of the trunk consist of the world’s richest one percent, who also saw their incomes soar. The rest of the trunk tip, which includes the next 4 percent down, didn’t do badly either. Where the bend of the trunk hovers over the floor around the 85th percentile we see globalization’s “losers”: the lower middle classes of the rich world, who gained less than 10 percent. — location: [2348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2348) ^ref-60835

The rich certainly have prospered more than anyone else, perhaps more than they should have, but the claim about everyone else is not accurate, for a number of reasons. — location: [2376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2376) ^ref-8097

The first is the difference between relative and absolute prosperity. — location: [2396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2396) ^ref-21554

Inequality undoubtedly increased—the rich got richer faster than the poor and middle class got richer—but everyone (on average) got richer. — location: [2405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2405) ^ref-26169

The second confusion is the one between anonymous and longitudinal data. — location: [2406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2406) ^ref-12323

---
A third reason that rising inequality has not made the lower classes worse off is that low incomes have been mitigated by social transfers. — location: [2416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2416) ^ref-24735

Education, a major driver of economic mobility, is not keeping up with the demands of modern economies: tertiary education has soared in cost (defying the inexpensification of almost every other good), and in poor American neighborhoods, primary and secondary education are unconscionably substandard. — location: [2485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2485) ^ref-59990

One can think of democracy as a form of government that threads the needle, exerting just enough force to prevent people from preying on each other without preying on the people itself.

The experimenters found that each group was momentarily swayed by the result they had just learned, but as soon as they had had a chance to read the details, they picked nits in whichever study was uncongenial to their starting position, saying things like “The evidence is meaningless without data about how the overall crime rate went up in those years,” or “There might be different circumstances between the two states even though they shared a border.” Thanks to this selective prosecution, the participants were more polarized after they had all been exposed to the same evidence than before: the antis were more anti, the pros more pro.24 — location: [7195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=7195) ^ref-13974

Tetlock’s superforecasters were: pragmatic experts who drew on many analytical tools, with the choice of tool hinging on the particular problem they faced. These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they could. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their speech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on the other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not certainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more readily admitted it and changed their minds.47 — location: [7383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=7383) ^ref-45257
