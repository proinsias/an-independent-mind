## Highlights

The conviction that we know others better than they know us—and that we may have insights about them they lack (but not vice versa)—leads us to talk when we would do well to listen and to be less patient than we ought to be when others express the conviction that they are the ones who are being misunderstood or judged unfairly. — location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=557) ^ref-24384

---

We think we can easily see into the hearts of others based on the flimsiest of clues. We jump at the chance to judge strangers. — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=563) ^ref-35578

---

Strangers are not easy. — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=565) ^ref-30122

---

The issue with spies is not that there is something brilliant about them. It is that there is something wrong with us. — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=761) ^ref-16792

---

We have a default to truth: our operating assumption is that the people we are dealing with are honest. — location: [815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=815) ^ref-43231

---

We start by believing. And we stop believing only when our doubts and misgivings rise — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=826) ^ref-26034

---

to the point where we can no longer explain them away. — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=827) ^ref-31661

---

Belief is not the absence of doubt. You believe someone because you don't have enough doubts about them. — location: [877](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=877) ^ref-64212

---

were there enough red flags to push you over the threshold of belief? If there weren't, then by defaulting to truth you were only being human. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=881) ^ref-57275

---

went with the odds: that's what we do when we default to truth. — location: [1134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1134) ^ref-60020

---

The statistics say that the liar and the con man are rare. But to the Holy Fool, they are everywhere. — location: [1136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1136) ^ref-64868

---

we can't all be Holy Fools. That would be a disaster. — location: [1138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1138) ^ref-47727

---

What we get in exchange for being vulnerable to an occasional lie is efficient communication and social coordination. — location: [1142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1142) ^ref-51357

---

Default to truth biases us in favor of the most likely interpretation. — location: [1463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1463) ^ref-50006

---

But defaulting to truth is not a crime. It is a fundamentally human tendency. — location: [1569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1569) ^ref-25151

---

We default to truth—even when that decision carries terrible risks—because we have no choice. Society cannot function otherwise. — location: [1575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1575) ^ref-47782

---

When we don't know someone, or can't communicate with them, or don't have the time to understand them properly, we believe we can make sense of them through their behavior and demeanor. — location: [1696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=1696) ^ref-62889

---

But with strangers, we're intolerant of emotional responses that fall outside expectations. — location: [2017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2017) ^ref-64911

---

we have built a world that systematically discriminates against a class of people who, through no fault of their own, violate our ridiculous ideas about transparency. — location: [2051](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2051) ^ref-30002

When one college student meets another—even in cases where both have the best of intentions—the task of inferring sexual intent from behavior is essentially a coin flip. — location: [2180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2180) ^ref-22659

Many of those who study alcohol no longer consider it an agent of disinhibition. They think of it as an agent of myopia. — location: [2332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2332) ^ref-64437

---

that alcohol's principal effect is to narrow our emotional and mental fields of vision. — location: [2334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2334) ^ref-54318

The kinds of conflicts that normally keep our impulses in check are a crucial part of how we form our character. — location: [2355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2355) ^ref-31509

At a blood-alcohol level of roughly 0.08—the legal level of intoxication—the hippocampus starts to struggle. — location: [2425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2425) ^ref-22846

a blood-alcohol level of 0.15—the hippocampus simply shuts down entirely. — location: [2433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2433) ^ref-372

But the harder we work at getting strangers to reveal themselves, the more elusive they become. — location: [2926](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2926) ^ref-31318

the search to understand a stranger has real limits. — location: [2936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=2936) ^ref-11340

Overwhelmingly, the people who want to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge at a given moment want to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge only at that given moment. — location: [3080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=3080) ^ref-13226

---

The first set of mistakes we make with strangers—the default to truth and the illusion of transparency—has to do with our inability to make sense of the stranger as an individual. But on top of those errors we add another, which pushes our problem with strangers into crisis. We do not understand the importance of the context in which the stranger is operating. — location: [3105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=3105) ^ref-12663

---

when you confront the stranger, you have to ask yourself where and when you're confronting the stranger—because — location: [3158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=3158) ^ref-8799

If you're going to use trivial, trumped-up reasons for pulling someone over, make sure you act that way all the time. — location: [3610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=3610) ^ref-45198

The first question for Brian Encinia is: did he do the right thing? But the second question is just as important: was he in the right place? — location: [3776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07NDKVWZW&location=3776) ^ref-39356
