## Highlights
Humans instinctively perceive numbers logarithmically, not linearly. — location: [115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=115) ^ref-48794

---
Even after a lifetime of education dealing with small numbers, there is a vestigial instinct that larger numbers are logarithmic; that the gap between a trillion and a billion feels about the same as the jump between a million and a billion—because both are a thousand times bigger. — location: [123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=123) ^ref-23563

---
Which makes the amount of mathematics we use in our modern society both incredible and terrifying. — location: [141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=141) ^ref-21407

I believe that “regardless of flight phase” is official FAA-speak for “This could go down midflight.” — location: [189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=189) ^ref-2967

Only if you push exactly at the rate that matches when the child is directly in front of you and starting their descent will you achieve success. When the timing of your effort matches the frequency the swing is moving at, each push adds a little more energy into the system. This will build up with each push until the child is moving too fast to easily inhale and their screaming will finally cease. — location: [510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=510) ^ref-59436

The British Empire was all about trains, and British engineers prided themselves on their stiff upper bridges. — location: [593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=593) ^ref-39212

---
The only downside is that mathematics and experience now allow humans to build structures beyond what our intuition can comprehend. — location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=666) ^ref-62386

If you convert the base-10 number 19,527 to base-16, you get 4C47. Here, the C is not a letter, despite still looking like one; it is a digit. Specifically, it is the digit that represents a value of twelve. — location: [890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=890) ^ref-27114

The space shuttle taking off on the left is surprisingly accurate, ascending to the side instead of directly up. This may look incorrect, but the space shuttle needed a huge amount of sideways speed to be able to get into orbit. Space is not that far away: as I type, the International Space Station is at an altitude of only 262 miles. But for something to stay in that orbit, it needs to be moving around the Earth at about 17,000 miles per hour, that is, 4.75 miles every second. Getting to space is easy. It’s staying there that’s difficult. — location: [1153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1153) ^ref-40512

The heat from the fire increased the air pressure in the cabin to the point where it was impossible to open the hatch. — location: [1217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1217) ^ref-62965

This tragedy led to a numerical quirk of the Apollo missions. Even though the spacecraft never launched, the mission with Gus Grissom, Edward White II, and Roger Chaffee was retrospectively named Apollo 1 out of respect for them, rather than keeping its codename, AS-204. Officially, the first actual launch should have been named Apollo 1, but AS-204 was declared to be the first official Apollo flight, despite the fact that it “failed on ground test.” This had a weird follow-on effect because, now, two previous crewless launches (AS-201 and AS-202; AS-203 was a payloadless rocket test and so not an official launch) were also retrospectively part of the Apollo program, even though they were never given Apollo names. The first Saturn V rocket launch thus became known as Apollo 4, giving us the niche bit of trivia that Apollo 2 and Apollo 3 never existed. — location: [1223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1223) ^ref-49529

The final report bears all this out. The performance of the rubber O-rings was definitely the primary cause of the accident and remains the headline finding that most people remember. But as well as the O-ring findings, and recommendations for how NASA should handle communication between the engineers and management, there is Finding #5: “significant out-of-round conditions existed between the two segments.” NASA undone by simple geometry. — location: [1267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1267) ^ref-51421

It said that most escalators on the Tube are refurbished twice, which gives them “twice the life.” This is perfect fence-post-problem territory: something is alternating (escalator is used, escalator is refurbished, repeat), and it must begin and end with the same thing (escalator being used). If an escalator is refurbished twice, then it will be in use three times longer than it would be if it was never refurbished at all. The people who run the Tube forgot to mind the gap. — location: [1403](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1403) ^ref-9762

well-meaning people maintaining that the answer to dividing by zero is infinity. It is not. — location: [1804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1804) ^ref-22447

---
If the limiting value is different depending on the direction you approach it from, then, in mathematics, we say that limit is “undefined.” You cannot divide by zero. The limit does not exist. — location: [1807](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1807) ^ref-40272

The poor Casio is continually subtracting zero from forty-two and keeping count of how many times it has done so. — location: [1821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=1821) ^ref-62725

This is a game known as Penney ante (named for its inventor, Walter Penney), and it has been used to separate humans from their cash for years. In the game of Penney ante, people get thrown because every option of three heads and tails has a different combination that is more likely to win. It is unsettling that there is no best option to pick that is more likely to win than all the others. But this exact oddity is the basis of the game rock-paper-scissors. Any option picked can be beaten by one of the other options. — location: [2004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2004) ^ref-4077

It seems the first human whose name has been passed down through millennia of history was not a ruler, a warrior, or a priest . . . but an accountant. — location: [2177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2177) ^ref-10322

---
One solution is always to round to the nearest even number, with the theory that now each 0.5 has a random chance of being rounded up or rounded down. This averages out the upward bias but does now bias the data toward even numbers, which could, hypothetically, cause other problems. — location: [2468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2468) ^ref-17686

It does also have the side effect of rounding down the number of people who will lend you money to zero. — location: [2553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2553) ^ref-60393

Within the system are multiple layers, each with its own defenses and safeguards to slow mistakes. But each layer has holes. They are like slices of Swiss cheese. — location: [2822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2822) ^ref-14978

people will inevitably make mistakes a certain percentage of the time. — location: [2824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2824) ^ref-6693

---
It is my uninformed impression that in some industries, such as medicine and finance, which do tend to blame the individual, ignoring the whole system can lead to a culture of not admitting mistakes when they happen. Which, ironically, makes the system less able to deal with them. — location: [2829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2829) ^ref-24030

If humans are going to continue to engineer things beyond what we can perceive, then we need to also use the same intelligence to build systems that allow them to be used and maintained by actual humans. — location: [2875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=2875) ^ref-6488

A patient taking phenobarbital (an antiepileptic drug) was prescribed 0.5 gr per day (32.4 milligrams), and this was mistaken for 0.5 grams per day (500 milligrams). After three days on over fifteen times their normal dose, the patient started to have respiratory problems, but thankfully, when taken off the dose, made a full recovery. This was a case of no grain, no pain. — location: [3163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07R8QSXYB&location=3163) ^ref-65162

there was a cause of accidents not represented by the Swiss cheese model: layers and steps within a system could themselves cause mistakes to happen.
