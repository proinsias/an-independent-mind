## Highlights

Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're the same thing. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=229) ^ref-29422

no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she's happy. She just is. — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=242) ^ref-46278

We joke online about "first-world problems," but we really have become victims of our own success. Stress-related health issues, anxiety disorders, and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years, despite the fact that everyone has a flat-screen TV and can have their groceries delivered. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=293) ^ref-18829

Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you're perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=359) ^ref-60643

You can't be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others. — location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=399) ^ref-34340

To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity. — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=404) ^ref-30884

chances are you don't have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. And that's your real problem. — location: [418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=418) ^ref-47193

---

when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. I think what most people—especially educated, pampered middle-class white people—consider "life problems" are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=419) ^ref-34131

the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=459) ^ref-15556

We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature's preferred agent for inspiring change. — location: [529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=529) ^ref-12724

our own pain and misery aren't a bug of human evolution; they're a feature. — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=533) ^ref-20389

Happiness comes from solving problems. — location: [573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=573) ^ref-5304

True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. — location: [581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=581) ^ref-21401

negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it's because you're supposed to do something. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=610) ^ref-59158

"What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?" Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out. — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=643) ^ref-7351

the solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience—not the avoidance of it, not the salvation from it. — location: [654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=654) ^ref-33371

The true measurement of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but rather how she feels about her negative experiences. — location: [766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=766) ^ref-11928

this assumed inability to solve our problems causes us to feel miserable and helpless. — location: [857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=857) ^ref-27221

The more exposed we are to opposing viewpoints, the more we seem to get upset that those other viewpoints exist. — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=900) ^ref-25558

The easier and more problem-free our lives become, the more we seem to feel entitled for them to get even better. — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=900) ^ref-29412

Yet the vast majority of life resides in the humdrum middle. The vast majority of life is unextraordinary, indeed quite average. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=921) ^ref-10110

This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal. — location: [922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=922) ^ref-54894

---

Millennials often get blamed for this cultural shift, but that's likely because millennials are the most plugged-in and visible generation. In fact, the tendency toward entitlement is apparent across all of society. And I believe it's linked to mass-media-driven exceptionalism. — location: [929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=929) ^ref-55193

---

The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they're exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they're obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=956) ^ref-20553

and that they could be so much better. — location: [959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=959) ^ref-34220

maybe they're ordinary for a reason: because they are what actually matters. — location: [972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=972) ^ref-4852

they would see that their original analysis was based on avoiding responsibility for their own problem, rather than accurately identifying the problem.

The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves? — location: [1167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1167) ^ref-21839

Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else. — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1180) ^ref-23188

If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success. — location: [1183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1183) ^ref-34264

---

some values and metrics are better than others. Some lead to good problems that are easily and regularly solved. Others lead to bad problems that are not easily and regularly solved. — location: [1213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1213) ^ref-60459

---

The point is to nail down some good values and metrics, and pleasure and success will naturally emerge as a result. — location: [1271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1271) ^ref-57918

---

Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable. Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable. — location: [1274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1274) ^ref-11440

good, healthy values are achieved internally. — location: [1287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1287) ^ref-8677

Bad values are generally reliant on external events—flying — location: [1289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1289) ^ref-45292

paying vigilant attention to one's own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective. — location: [1319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1319) ^ref-60740

---

This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don't always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. — location: [1375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1375) ^ref-52868

A lot of people hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for your problems is to also be at fault for your problems. — location: [1419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1419) ^ref-50502

We are responsible for experiences that aren't our fault all the time. This is part of life. — location: [1432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1432) ^ref-2876

---

Here's one way to think about the distinction between the two concepts. Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense. Fault results from choices that have already been made. Responsibility results from the choices you're currently making, every second of every day. — location: [1433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1433) ^ref-59764

---

Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you. Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you. This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. You always get to choose the metric by which to measure your experiences. — location: [1439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1439) ^ref-44384

---

To simply blame others is only to hurt yourself. — location: [1479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1479) ^ref-51732

---

We should prioritize values of being honest, fostering transparency, and welcoming doubt over the values of being right, feeling good, and getting revenge. These "democratic" values are harder to maintain amidst the constant noise of a networked world. But we must accept the responsibility and nurture them regardless. The future stability of our political systems may depend on it. — location: [1606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1606) ^ref-43283

We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection. — location: [1658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1658) ^ref-42460

Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we're wrong all the time. Because we are. — location: [1686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1686) ^ref-15293

When we let go of the stories we tell about ourselves, to ourselves, we free ourselves up to actually act (and fail) and grow. — location: [1866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1866) ^ref-44685

if it feels like it's you versus the world, chances are it's really just you versus yourself. — location: [1953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1953) ^ref-17597

---

Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you've failed at something. If someone is better than you at something, then it's likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it's likely because he hasn't been through all of the painful learning experiences you have. — location: [1994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1994) ^ref-33451

We can be truly successful only at something we're willing to fail — location: [2006](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2006) ^ref-29527

pain is part of the process. It's important to feel it. Because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you'll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change. — location: [2057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2057) ^ref-20851

VCR questions are funny because the answer appears difficult to anyone who has them and appears easy to anyone who does not. — location: [2079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2079) ^ref-42262

When the standard of success becomes merely acting—when any result is regarded as progress and important, when inspiration is seen as a reward rather than a prerequisite—we propel ourselves ahead.

the practice of meditation is often taught as a means of preparing oneself for death while still remaining alive.
