Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=289) ^ref-41320

You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=322) ^ref-38907

That's the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=384) ^ref-39760
