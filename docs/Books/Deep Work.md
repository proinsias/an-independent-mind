## Highlights
Deep Work: — location: [61](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=61) ^ref-63166

---
Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. — location: [61](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=61) ^ref-64092

---
Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. — location: [101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=101) ^ref-48912

---
The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. — location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=195) ^ref-24537

---
I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule. Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output. — location: [217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=217) ^ref-2591

---
to cultivate an ability to produce real value in an increasingly distracted world; and to recognize a truth embraced by the most productive and important personalities of generations past: A deep life is a good life. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=235) ^ref-53254

Deep Work Is Valuable — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=241) ^ref-14832

In other words, talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=297) ^ref-29320

the consumer will choose the very best. Even if the talent advantage of the best is small compared to the next rung down on the skill ladder, the superstars still win the bulk of the market. — location: [299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=299) ^ref-48473

Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. — location: [334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=334) ^ref-24253

The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work. — location: [372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=372) ^ref-26266

In the absence of such measures, irrational outcomes, such as executive salaries way out of proportion to the executive’s marginal productivity, can occur. — location: [619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=619) ^ref-7393

The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. — location: [649](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=649) ^ref-36288

---
If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a question or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier—at least, in the moment. If you couldn’t count on this quick response time you’d instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you requested. All of this would make the day to day of your working life harder (even if it produced more satisfaction and a better outcome in the long term). — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=652) ^ref-49490

Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. — location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=715) ^ref-12691

---
Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. Even worse, to support deep work often requires the rejection of much of what is new and high-tech. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=778) ^ref-30260

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. — location: [934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=934) ^ref-37886

In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=966) ^ref-3531

the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1180) ^ref-33729

By reducing the need to make decisions about deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy for the deep thinking itself. — location: [1288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1288) ^ref-27387

The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing. — location: [1557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1557) ^ref-48741

At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. — location: [1588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1588) ^ref-47681

ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. — location: [1674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1674) ^ref-13205

Rule #2 Embrace Boredom — location: [1711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1711) ^ref-59180

---
Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom. — location: [1742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1742) ^ref-967

---
If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. — location: [1756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1756) ^ref-58371

---
you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. — location: [1783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1783) ^ref-44593

---
Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. — location: [1787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1787) ^ref-55144

---
It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty. — location: [1791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1791) ^ref-53027

---
Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use. — location: [1808](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1808) ^ref-21593

---
from a behavioralist perspective, it’s substantial because it separates the sensation of wanting to go online from the reward of actually doing so. — location: [1820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1820) ^ref-52145

---
Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training. — location: [1822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1822) ^ref-31063

throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom. — location: [1831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1831) ^ref-26340

---
One place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside work is when you’re forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a store). It’s crucial in these situations that if you’re in an offline block, you simply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts. — location: [1832](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1832) ^ref-18361

---
This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. — location: [1837](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1837) ^ref-35788

One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it. — location: [1914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=1914) ^ref-4406

Personal Goal: To maintain close and rewarding friendships with a group of people who are important to me.   Key Activities Supporting This Goal: 1. Regularly take the time for meaningful connection with those who are most important to me (e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint activity). 2. Give of myself to those who are most important to me (e.g., making nontrivial sacrifices that improve their lives). — location: [2198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=2198) ^ref-20825

The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes. — location: [2225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=2225) ^ref-19721

---
There’s a formal mathematical underpinning to this phenomenon (an 80/20 split is roughly what you would expect when describing a power law distribution over impact—a type of distribution that shows up often when measuring quantities in the real world), but it’s probably most useful when applied heuristically as a reminder that, in many cases, contributions to an outcome are not evenly distributed. — location: [2228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=2228) ^ref-13782

this law says that it’s the top two or three such activities—the number that this strategy asks you to focus on—that make most of the difference in whether or not you succeed with the goal. — location: [2234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=2234) ^ref-18124

And because your time returns substantially more rewards when invested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-impact activities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall benefit. — location: [2241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=2241) ^ref-31674
