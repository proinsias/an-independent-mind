## Highlights

An ironic death for someone with a leaky space suit: too much oxygen. — location: [166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=166) ^ref-9780

---

My asshole is doing as much to keep me alive as my brain. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=294) ^ref-23350

---

There'll be a lot of H2O at the end, but I'll be too dead to appreciate it. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=482) ^ref-53008

---

I'll vent it into the Hab via the highly scientific method of detaching the tank from the MAV landing struts, bringing it into the Hab, then opening the valve until it's empty. — location: [510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=510) ^ref-634

---

this plan provides many opportunities for me to die in a fiery explosion. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=514) ^ref-24152

---

If you asked every engineer at NASA what the worst scenario for the Hab was, they'd all answer "fire." If you asked them what the result would be, they'd answer "death by fire." — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=517) ^ref-1985

---

I guess you could call it a "failure," but I prefer the term "learning experience." — location: [1134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=1134) ^ref-42407

---

Maybe I'll post a consumer review. "Brought product to surface of Mars. It stopped working. 0/10." — location: [1956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=1956) ^ref-61209

---

Look! A pair of boobs! -> (.Y.) — location: [1987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=1987) ^ref-49480

---

"You abandoned me on Mars, you assholes!" — location: [2255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=2255) ^ref-58422

---

"Anything, oh God, ANYTHING but Disco" — location: [2286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=2286) ^ref-4152

---

To them, equipment failure is terrifying. To me, it's "Tuesday." — location: [2313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=2313) ^ref-17500

---

I did, however, glue my hand to the helmet. Stop laughing. — location: [2482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=2482) ^ref-2440

---

Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped. — location: [3339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=3339) ^ref-42333

---

As with most of life's problems, this one can be solved by a box of pure radiation. — location: [3522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=3522) ^ref-32356

---

Only an idiot would keep that thing near the Hab. So anyway, I brought it back to the Hab. — location: [3549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=3549) ^ref-29146

---

I tested the brackets by hitting them with rocks. This kind of sophistication is what we interplanetary scientists are known for. — location: [3630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=3630) ^ref-29539

---

I'm concerned about what I ate last night. I think it had an eyeball in it." "I'm sure there wasn't an eyeball." "The engineers here made it for me special," Mitch said. "There may have been an eyeball," Venkat said. "They hate you." — location: [3747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=3747) ^ref-5932

---

Back on Earth, universities and governments are willing to pay millions to get their hands on Mars rocks. I'm using them as ballast. — location: [4204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4204) ^ref-51502

---

I'm a well-honed machine in times of crisis. As soon as the rover toppled, I curled into a ball and cowered. That's the kind of action hero I am. — location: [4707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4707) ^ref-42115

---

"Funny," Venkat said. "Be a smart-ass to a guy seven levels above you at your company. See how that works out." "Oh no," Mindy said. "I might lose my job as an interplanetary voyeur? I guess I'd have to use my master's degree for something else." — location: [4743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4743) ^ref-39147

driving the speed limit makes you a road hazard. — location: [4851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4851) ^ref-25234

He stumbled excitedly out of the airlock, falling to the ground then scrambling to his feet. Beholding the MAV, he gestured to it with both arms, as if in disbelief. He leaped into the air several times, arms held high with fists clenched. Then he knelt on one knee and fist-pumped repeatedly. Running to the spacecraft, he hugged Landing Strut B. After a few moments, he broke off the embrace to perform another round of leaping celebrations. Now fatigued, the astronaut stood with arms akimbo, looking up at the sleek lines of the engineering marvel before him. — location: [4882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4882) ^ref-7498

"You're sending him to space under a tarp." — location: [4956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4956) ^ref-25753

---

"Like a hastily loaded pickup truck." — location: [4957](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4957) ^ref-9725

---

MAV: You're sending me into space in a convertible. — location: [4972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4972) ^ref-40516

---

MAV: So it's a ragtop. Much better. — location: [4974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=4974) ^ref-44789

---

There aren't many people who can say they've vandalized a three-billion-dollar spacecraft, but I'm one of them. — location: [5033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5033) ^ref-60324

---

It's nice to know that my launch to orbit won't have any pesky backup systems weighing me down. — location: [5035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5035) ^ref-60250

---

Hurray for standardized valve systems! — location: [5058](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5058) ^ref-4548

---

If I survive this, I'll tell people I was pissing rocket fuel. — location: [5061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5061) ^ref-32045

---

What? Just 'cause you guys abandoned me on a godforsaken planet with no chance of survival? — location: [5068](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5068) ^ref-13371

---

In four hours, I'm going to ride a giant explosion into orbit. — location: [5122](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5122) ^ref-62513

---

I'm leaving forty-one potatoes behind. That's how close I came to starvation. — location: [5126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5126) ^ref-64958

---

I'd get to fly around like Iron Man." "We'll keep working on ideas," Lewis said. "Iron Man, Commander. Iron Man." — location: [5305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5305) ^ref-44943

---

"Oh," Lewis said, "well if you won't let us then— Wait…wait a minute….I'm looking at my shoulder patch and it turns out I'm the commander. Sit tight. We're coming to get you." "Smart-ass." — location: [5379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5379) ^ref-9763

---

I didn't want to distract the people who were saving my life, so I muted my mic and screamed like a little girl. It's true, you know. In space, no one can hear you scream like a little girl. — location: [5533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5533) ^ref-49842

---

If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it's found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don't care, but they're massively outnumbered by the people who do. — location: [5553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EMXBDMA&location=5553) ^ref-45006
