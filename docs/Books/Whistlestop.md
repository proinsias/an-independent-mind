Woodward and Bernstein revealed the president's reelection campaign was behind a phony letter that destroyed the Democratic Party front-runner, and yet Nixon went on to win that election.

When George Washington left the White House, he warned against the "spirit of party" that would turn the disputes between men like Jefferson and Hamilton into a permanent state of combat. It was too late; the debate between the Hamiltonian Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans over the best way to interpret the Constitution and the authority it gave to the federal government was well established.
