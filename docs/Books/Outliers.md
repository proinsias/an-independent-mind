# Outliers

by [[Malcolm Gladwell]]

## Summary

<!--The Book in 3 Sentences. No more than a couple paragraphs summarizing this BOOK -->

## Quotes

> It's not enough to ask **what successful people are like**, in other words, it is only by asking **where they are from** that we can begin to unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.

> Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.

> This wasn't just a revolution. It was a revelation.

## Notes

- The [Matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect?wprov=sfti1)of accumulated advantage, Matthew principle, or Matthew effect is the tendency of individuals to accrue social or economic success in proportion to their initial level of popularity, friends, wealth, etc.
  - Example of kids sports with cutoffs. Kids with birthdates on either side of the cutoff have a difference of a year's maturation. The older kid gets preferential treatment and this effect is compounded. Solution could be to have multiple leagues divided by birth month.
- The 10,000 hour rule.
  - It's hard to get these hours in if you're working a part time job. Really you need to get into a special program.
