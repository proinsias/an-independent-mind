# Large language models (LLMs)

## Introduction

-   Generative AI ([GenAI](GenAI.md)) is the area of AI that focuses on creating (generating) new content
	-   Audio
	-   Images
	- Text
-   GenAI models are trained on large amounts of data and learn to mimic patterns in that data
-   LLMs are a type of GenAI focused on text data
	-   “Large”
		- Trained on vast amount of data (GPT-3.5 ~45 terabytes of data)
		- Huge number of parameters in the model (GPT-3.5 175 billion)
	-   Generate human-like text and understand context

## ChatGPT

-   LLM developed by OpenAI
-   GPT - Generative Pretraining Transformer
-   Can write essays, summarize text/data, translate languages, answer questions, write code
-   It can understand context and intent, allowing it to provide relevant human like response to prompts 
-  Trained on data up to September 2021
- Predicts what words and sentences are associated with the input and chooses what to output
- Randomization element ensures output is not always the same
