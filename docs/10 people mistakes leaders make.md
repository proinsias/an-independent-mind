# 10 people mistakes leaders make

## Quotes

What really haunts leaders on a day-to-day basis is the mistakes that they make. They don't trip up because they are bad people; they most often fumble because of a lack of knowledge, bad habits, or too much stress.

1. Not taking time to bond with people
    1. You do have to get to know who the person is and understand what motivates them.
    2. It can be achieved through non-verbal communication like smiling, using eye contact, or paying attention to your tone of voice, or verbally by giving appropriate compliments or praise.
    3. It means finding opportunities to interact with your team members beyond purely just dealing with the task at hand by asking questions or displaying behavior that shows you are interested in them.
2. Being unavailable and inaccessible
    1. Leaders who assign tasks and walk away with a completely hands off approach abandon their people. Good delegation relies on signaling a willingness to remain connected and available.
    2. You \[don't\] have to respond to every small request straightaway. \[You do need to create\] channels for people to reach you as well as guidelines for using those channels.
3. Not focusing on developing talent
    1. Too often, leaders focus exclusively on achieving company goals, and in that push deny the inherent human need to learn.
    2. When you prioritize learning, you become a great leader who can spot and develop talent in people who might themselves be unaware of it.
4. Not giving regular feedback about performance
    1. People achieve high performance only if they know the truth about their effectiveness.
    2. \[This is the \] key to develop their skills and talents.
5. Not taking emotions into account
    1. \[Show\] authentic empathy in that part of a person's experience.
    2. Learn to use respectfully the question, 'How do you feel?" and not just, "What do you think?"
6. Managing conflict ineffectively
    1. Conflicts that are not addressed can block co-operation and alignment around common goals.
7. Not driving change
    1. Explain the benefits that changes will bring â€“ and do so knowing that people do not naturally resist change: they resist the fear of the unknown or the pain that might come with the transition.
    2. Our job is to be a "secure base" who gives a sense of psychological safety as well as the encouragement and energy to explore.
8. Not encouraging others to take risks
    1. Too many leaders encourage people to stay in their comfort zone, or, as I like to say, "play not to lose".
    2. The best leaders create enough trust so that others feel safe and supported to take risks and "play to win".
9. Misunderstanding motivation
    1. Most people are driven by "intrinsic motivators" like being challenged, learning something new, making an important difference, having a meaning or purpose, or developing their talents.
    2. Too many leaders miss the opportunity to capitalize on this internal guidance system and instead focus on "extrinsic motivators" like bonuses, promotions, money, and artificial rewards.
10. Managing activities rather than leading people
    1. So much of management is about controlling, administering, and planning activities, and, by extension, people.
    2. Leadership, on the other hand, involves inspiring, encouraging, and bringing out the very best in people by building a sense of trust and by challenging them to take positive risks.
