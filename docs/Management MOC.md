## Quotes

> In the cultures of some companies, management depends heavily on the innate goodness and professionalism of its employees to constantly compensate for systemic deficiencies, chronic understaffing, and substandard subcontractors.

From [Sully](Sully.md).

> Managers should show the way, clear the way, lead the way.

> As a leader, making time to act deliberately, plan long-term projects, and prioritize problems that need to be solved are among your most important functions. Neglecting them will harm your team much more than being a little slow to respond to emails and messages.
> 
> Great leaders aren’t the ones who do more; they’re the ones who know how to prioritize best. They’re the ones who make time to really investigate problems and come up with rock-solid solutions. They’re the ones who make time to act deliberately.
