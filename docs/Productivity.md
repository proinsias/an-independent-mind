## Quotes

> No one achieves greatness by becoming a generalist. You don’t hone a skill by diluting your attention to its development. The only way to get to the next level is focus.

– John C. Maxwell

> [Every high performer is fundamentally relaxed, and practices minimal use of effort to get a given result. Don't try harder: eliminate tensions.](https://twitter.com/sanityinc/status/1309974689268129792)
