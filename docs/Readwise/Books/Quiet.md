## Highlights
- It affects the careers we choose and whether or not we succeed at them. It governs how likely we are to exercise, commit adultery, function well without sleep, learn from our mistakes, place big bets in the stock market, delay gratification, be a good leader, and ask “what if.” ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=220))
- We like to think that we value individuality, but all too often we admire one type of individual—the kind who’s comfortable “putting himself out there.” ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=246))
- Talkative people, for example, are rated as smarter, better-looking, more interesting, and more desirable as friends. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=254))
- Velocity of speech counts as well as volume: we rank fast talkers as more competent and likable than slow ones. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=254))
- Of course, there’s another word for such people: thinkers. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=297))
- adherents of the Big Five school of personality psychology (which argues that human personality can be boiled down to five primary traits) define introversion not in terms of a rich inner life but as a lack of qualities such as assertiveness and sociability. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=355))
- They enjoy “the thrill of the chase” for rewards like money and status. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=366))
- Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately. They like to focus on one task at a time and can have mighty powers of concentration. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=367))
- They’re relatively immune to the lures of wealth and fame. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=368))
- occasionally blurt out things they never meant to say. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=371))
- Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=379))
- calm extroverts, anxious (or impulsive) extroverts, calm introverts, and anxious introverts. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=383))
- If you found yourself with a roughly equal number of “true” and “false” answers, then you may be an ambivert—yes, there really is such a word. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=417))
- Introversion and extroversion interact with our other personality traits and personal histories, producing wildly different kinds of people. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=423))
- the ability to get along with colleagues while simultaneously outshining them. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=481))
- In the Culture of Character, the ideal self was serious, disciplined, and honorable. What counted was not so much the impression one made in public as how one behaved in private. The word personality didn’t exist in English until the eighteenth century, and the idea of “having a good personality” was not widespread until the twentieth. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=496))
- “Every American was to become a performing self.” ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=500))
- It was no coincidence that in the 1920s and the 1930s, Americans became obsessed with movie stars. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=538))
- “Save for a few odd parents, most are grateful that the schools work so hard to offset tendencies to introversion and other suburban abnormalities.” ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=601))
- The trait has been found to be less prevalent in Asia and Africa than in Europe and America, whose populations descend largely from the migrants of the world. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=632))
- cri de coeur ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=658))
    - Note: Literally, a cry from the heart.
      An impassioned outcry.
- The most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), the psychiatrist’s bible of mental disorders, considers the fear of public speaking to be a pathology—not an annoyance, not a disadvantage, but a disease—if it interferes with the sufferer’s job performance. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=667))
- All of which raises the question, how did we go from Character to Personality without realizing that we had sacrificed something meaningful along the way? ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=700))
- we tend to think that becoming more extroverted not only makes us more successful, but also makes us better people. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=839))
- Unless they’re self-employed or able to telecommute, many adults work in offices where they must take care to glide down the corridors greeting their colleagues warmly and confidently. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=940))
- Usually it’s said that they were carried away by the situation, but that’s not right. Usually they’re carried away by people who are assertive and domineering. The risk with our students is that they’re very good at getting their way. But that doesn’t mean they’re going the right way.” ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=987))
- The “Bus to Abilene” anecdote reveals our tendency to follow those who initiate action—any action. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1011))
- failure to distinguish between good presentation skills and true leadership ability. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1013))
- confuse schmoozing ability with talent. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1014))
- quiet, humble, modest, reserved, shy, gracious, mild-mannered, self-effacing, understated. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1056))
- We don’t need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions they run. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1057))
- He was more interested in listening and gathering information than in asserting his opinion or dominating a conversation. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1067))
- introverts prefer to work independently, and solitude can be a catalyst to innovation ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1369))
- introversion “concentrates the mind on the tasks in hand, and prevents the dissipation of energy on social and sexual matters unrelated to work.” ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1370))
- “Innovation—the heart of the knowledge economy—is fundamentally social,” ([Location 1384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1384))
- “Serious study alone” is the strongest predictor of skill ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1477))
- Deliberate Practice, ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1482))
- I learned to not worry so much about the outcome, but to concentrate on the step I was on and to try to do it as perfectly as I could when I was doing it. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1499))
- excessive stimulation seems to impede learning: ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1543))
- the simple act of being interrupted is one of the biggest barriers to productivity. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1545))
- performance gets worse as group size increases: ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1609))
- The one exception to this is online brainstorming. Groups brainstorming electronically, when properly managed, not only do better than individuals, research shows; the larger the group, the better it performs. ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1612))
- participating in an online working group is a form of solitude all its own. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1619))
- The first is social loafing: in a group, some individuals tend to sit back and let others do the work. The second is production blocking: only one person can talk or produce an idea at once, while the other group members are forced to sit passively. And the third is evaluation apprehension, meaning the fear of looking stupid in front of one’s peers. ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1625))
- “they thought that they had arrived serendipitously at the same correct answer.” They were utterly blind, in other words, to how much their peers had influenced them. ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1668))
- they had nervous systems that were unmoved by novelty. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1806))
- But what we’re really observing is a child’s sensitivity to novelty in general, not just to people. ([Location 1811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1811))
- Extroverts are sometimes credited with being “pro-social”—meaning caring about others—and introverts disparaged as people who don’t like people. ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1815))
- High-reactive children pay what one psychologist calls “alert attention” to people and things. They literally use more eye movements than others to compare choices before making a decision. It’s as if they process more deeply—sometimes consciously, sometimes not—the information they take in about the world. ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1819))
- High-reactive kids also tend to think and feel deeply about what they’ve noticed, and to bring an extra degree of nuance to everyday experiences. ([Location 1825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1825))
- naked lions are just as dangerous as elegantly dressed ones. ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1905))
- To ask whether it’s nature or nurture, says Kagan, is like asking whether a blizzard is caused by temperature or humidity. It’s the intricate interaction between the two that makes us who we are. ([Location 1922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1922))
- orchid children are more strongly affected by all experience, both positive and negative. ([Location 1960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1960))
- (This is a hypothesis that might ring true to parents whose high-reactive children hover observantly on the edges of their peer group, sometimes for weeks or months, before edging successfully inside.) ([Location 1983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1983))
- He describes eloquently a high-reactive child’s ideal parent: someone who “can read your cues and respect your individuality; is warm and firm in placing demands on you without being harsh or hostile; promotes curiosity, academic achievement, delayed gratification, and self-control; and is not harsh, neglectful, or inconsistent.” This advice is terrific for all parents, of course, but it’s crucial for raising a high-reactive child. (If you think your child might be high-reactive, you’re probably already asking yourself what else you can do to cultivate your son or daughter. Chapter 11 has some answers.) ([Location 1999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=1999))
- Some high-reactives grew into socially fluid teenagers who were not outwardly rattled by novelty, but they never shed their genetic inheritance. ([Location 2056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2056))
- We are elastic and can stretch ourselves, but only so much. ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2064))
- In humans with unwarranted fears, like batophobia, or fear of heights, the same thing happens. ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2079))
    - Note: Huh? Heights can kill you. Not an unwarranted fear!
- Once you understand introversion and extroversion as preferences for certain levels of stimulation, ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2174))
- “optimal levels of arousal” ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2176))
- introverts function better than extroverts when sleep deprived, ([Location 2192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2192))
- introverts can find their attention impaired just when they need it most. ([Location 2198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2198))
- (In case you’re wondering, the woman in the experiments quickly returned to the room with the toy “fixed” and reassurances that the child had done nothing wrong.) ([Location 2433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2433))
    - Note: A nod to the extra-sensitive reader!
- the decline in empathy is related to the prevalence of social media, reality TV, and “hyper-competitiveness.”) ([Location 2442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2442))
- when they’re overwhelmed by negative emotions like shame or anxiety, says Aron, they can be positively oblivious of other people’s needs. ([Location 2445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2445))
- Their skin is literally “thicker,” more impervious to stimuli, cooler to the touch. ([Location 2456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2456))
- Maybe we’ve adopted dark glasses, relaxed body language, and alcohol as signifiers precisely because they camouflage signs of a nervous system on overdrive. ([Location 2470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2470))
- “they’re really saying hi, have a glass of extroversion.” ([Location 2473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2473))
- It’s not about isolating the person who feels ashamed (which is how it sometimes feels to easy blushers), but about bringing people together. ([Location 2495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2495))
- In other words, you want to make sure that your spouse cares what other people think. It’s better to mind too much than to mind too little. ([Location 2505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2505))
- both types of animals exist because they have radically different survival strategies, each of which pays off differently and at different times. ([Location 2538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2538))
- “There is no single best … [animal] personality,” writes Wilson, “but rather a diversity of personalities maintained by natural selection.” ([Location 2547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2547))
- Congress, he could have safely assumed, is made up of some of the least sensitive people in the country—people ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2604))
- These Ralph-like Congressmen can be wonderful people—exuberant, fearless, persuasive—but they’re unlikely to feel alarmed by a photograph of a tiny crack in a distant glacier. They need more intense stimulation to get them to listen. ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2608))
- Sensitive people seem to do the reverse. They “enjoy small talk only after they’ve gone deep,” ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2636))
- “When sensitive people are in environments that nurture their authenticity, they laugh and chitchat just as much as anyone else.” ([Location 2637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2637))
- if something moves me to tears of empathy or anxiety, he’ll be touched, but grow impatient if I stay that way too long. ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2652))
- “A lot of antisocial and self-defeating behavior results from people who amplify positive emotions.” ([Location 2773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2773))
- In the wake of the 2008 crash, a financial catastrophe caused in part by uncalculated risk-taking and blindness to threat, it became fashionable to speculate whether we’d have been better off with more women and fewer men—or less testosterone—on Wall Street. But maybe we should also ask what might have happened with a few more introverts at the helm—and a lot less dopamine. ([Location 2785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2785))
- business culture in which aggressive risk-takers enjoyed too high a status relative to cautious introverts. ([Location 2828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2828))
- If you force extroverts to pause, says Newman, they’ll do just as well as introverts at the numbers game. ([Location 2859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2859))
- Introverts are not smarter than extroverts. ([Location 2879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2879))
- And on many kinds of tasks, particularly those performed under time or social pressure or involving multitasking, extroverts do better. Extroverts are better than introverts at handling information overload. Introverts’ reflectiveness uses up a lot of cognitive capacity, ([Location 2880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2880))
- Extroverts appear to allocate most of their cognitive capacity to the goal at hand, while introverts use up capacity by monitoring how the task is going. ([Location 2884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2884))
- Extroverts are more likely to take a quick-and-dirty approach to problem-solving, trading accuracy for speed, making increasing numbers of mistakes as they go, and abandoning ship altogether when the problem seems too difficult or frustrating. ([Location 2886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2886))
- Introverts think before they act, digest information thoroughly, stay on task longer, give up less easily, and work more accurately. Introverts and extroverts also direct their attention differently: if you leave them to their own devices, the introverts tend to sit around wondering about things, imagining things, recalling events from their past, and making plans for the future. The extroverts are more likely to focus on what’s happening around them. It’s as if extroverts are seeing “what is” while their introverted peers are asking “what if.” ([Location 2888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2888))
- that there are some activities that are not about approach or avoidance, but about something deeper: the fulfillment that comes from absorption in an activity outside yourself. ([Location 2963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2963))
- The trick for introverts is to honor their own styles instead of allowing themselves to be swept up by prevailing norms. ([Location 2981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=2981))
- talk is for communicating need-to-know information; ([Location 3168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3168))
- What looks to Westerners like Asian deference, in other words, is actually a deeply felt concern for the sensibilities of others. ([Location 3212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3212))
- Though Eastern relationship-honoring is admirable and beautiful, so is Western respect for individual freedom, self-expression, and personal destiny. ([Location 3223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3223))
- Aggressive power beats you up; soft power wins you over.” ([Location 3334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3334))
- Gandhi himself ultimately rejected the phrase “passive resistance,” which he associated with weakness, preferring satyagraha, the term he coined to mean “firmness in pursuit of truth.” But as the word satyagraha implies, Gandhi’s passivity was not weakness at all. It meant focusing on an ultimate goal and refusing to divert energy to unnecessary skirmishes along the way. Restraint, Gandhi believed, was one of his greatest assets. ([Location 3379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3379))
- It meant focusing on an ultimate goal and refusing to divert energy to unnecessary skirmishes along the way. ([Location 3381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3381))
- Restraint, Gandhi believed, was one of his greatest assets. ([Location 3382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3382))
- A man has as many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself to each of these different groups ([Location 3434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3434))
- But if we’re capable of such flexibility, does it even make sense to chart the differences between introverts and extroverts? ([Location 3448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3448))
- Self-monitors are highly skilled at modifying their behavior to the social demands of a situation. ([Location 3558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3558))
- before I ever went to a dinner or cocktail party, I would have an index card with three to five relevant, amusing anecdotes. ([Location 3568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3568))
- And it can be especially tough for introverts, who have spent so much of their lives conforming to extroverted norms that by the time they choose a career, or a calling, it feels perfectly normal to ignore their own preferences. ([Location 3636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3636))
- You may have known more about who you were then than you do now. ([Location 3652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3652))
- “People who tend to [suppress their negative emotions] regularly,” concludes Grob, “might start to see the world in a more negative light.” ([Location 3742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3742))
- introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts prefer those they compete with. ([Location 3870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3870))
- venting doesn’t soothe anger; it fuels it ([Location 3905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3905))
- like the passive snake, they should be equally worried about encouraging vitriol from their partners. ([Location 3929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3929))
- extroverts are better at decoding social cues than introverts. ([Location 3959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3959))
- extroverts are sociable because their brains are good at handling competing demands on their attention—which ([Location 3970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=3970))
- instead of trying to sell them some knives, I’d ask a hundred questions in a row. ([Location 4015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WNL2&location=4015))
