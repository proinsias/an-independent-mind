## Highlights
- as much as my neighbors on Hobart Street speak to the values of diversity and tolerance, they have no real interest in viewpoint diversity. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=60))
- these are complicated issues, and most of us are far too uncertain and far too inexpert to render truly independent judgments on these matters, so we tend to follow the signals of the people we have been trained to trust. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=165))
- When we identify with a team, it changes how we perceive the world, not just opinions but the facts as well. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=184))
- The real question is how could they not see things differently from each other. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=215))
- how Americans are increasingly self-selecting into cities and even neighborhoods that are politically and socially congenial to them. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=218))
- We are becoming angrier and more polarized not because of increasing issue disagreement but because we are increasingly participating in groupthink. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=250))
- Polarization is increasing because polarization is increasingly easy. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=254))
- there are just too many lawful and unlawful ways to obtain a gun to believe that new restrictions will make a material impact on outcomes. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=392))
- But I have learned that it is not, and that if we really want to reduce gun violence, we should be focusing not first upon the weapons but on a lot of things around it: poverty, drugs, race, addressing mental illness, opportunity, and gangs, to name just a few. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=424))
- the only people who don’t have ready access to guns in the poorest sections of one the most violent cities in the United States are those who actually need them the most. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=743))
- the humanity and common purpose that unite us are stronger than the politics that occasionally divide us. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=987))
- a switch from telling to doing, from lecturing people on God’s edicts to demonstrating God’s love through good works. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1087))
- The congregation at Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas voted 577 to 367 to welcome gays as full participants in the church after its pastor declared his “judgment . . . that God is doing something beautiful here. I’m going to err on the side of love and grace.”12 ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1093))
- the “common bond of shared kinship” of any stable monogamous relationship, regardless of gender orientation. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1114))
- The biblical proscriptions against homosexuality thus are not about long-term monogamous commitments but against the exploitative, lustful, and transactional practices in Roman times that Jesus observed and decried. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1117))
- The sexually differentiated couple is thus blessed to “be fruitful and multiply,” but they are not commanded to do so. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1118))
- The character of marriage and kinship in the Bible, Brownson argues, is not about the physical differences that promote procreation but about the moral strength and stability of the relationships. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1119))
- It is, on the other hand, an act of courage to publicly support gay marriage when your peer group, your audience, or your customers have an entirely different perspective. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1137))
- Every verse in the Bible that is used to condemn a “homosexual” act is written in the context of rape, prostitution, idolatry, pederasty, military dominance, an affair, or adultery. It was always a destructive act. It was always a sin committed against a person. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1143))
- there is a significant correlation between single-parent households and poverty. In the United States, with relatively limited investments in child care and afterschool programs, the problem is particularly acute. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1175))
- single parents live constantly on the edge, trying and often failing to juggle jobs, children, illness, and security. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1179))
- That is why Jesus was so clear on divorce: not because of some arbitrary promise to keep family units together until “death do us part,” but because of the economic consequences of divorce, which at the time fell almost exclusively on women and children. ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1185))
- The consequences of the birth lottery are now greater than at any other time in modern American history. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1199))
- Liberals see the situation rather differently, that the rise in single-parent families reflects the effects of poverty and economic hopelessness. Marriage rates among the college-educated remain near historical norms, but it is among the working class, who face bleak prospects in a knowledge economy, that marriage has declined. ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1213))
- will make the United States, according to the Census Bureau, a “majority-minority” nation by 2044 ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1335))
- “These findings suggest that rather than ushering in a more tolerant future, the increasing diversity of the nation may actually yield more intergroup hostility,” ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1340))
- Whites, especially working-class whites, may not be a minority yet, but for all intents and purposes, they think and act like one already. ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1381))
- There has been no other public health crisis in the United States in the last half century of similar scale, with the possible exception of the AIDS crisis. It is made further remarkable by the fact that this epidemic—there really is no other word to describe it—has been so badly underreported, and by the fact that these are roughly categorized as “despair deaths.” This is the first major outbreak in modern epidemiological history that has no potential answer from medical science. ([Location 1489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1489))
- America is awash in drugs, illegal and legal, and like guns, they are widely available to those who want to use and abuse them. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1498))
- Because dependable blue-collar work is increasingly rare, young adults are in turn increasingly postponing marriage altogether, or seeing marriages disintegrate in the face of economic upheaval. Marriage has declined generally in this country, and remains lowest for blacks, but it has declined the most by far in the white working class. If ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1506))
- But, because cultural norms have shifted so much over the last half century, the men and women of the white working class are not postponing sex and children, and are instead creating substitute family life around short-term relationships. ([Location 1511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1511))
- members of the white working class have—and are entitled to have—a fairly bleak view of the future. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1523))
- By virtually every measure—income, employment, wealth, access to education, marriage rates, and home ownership—working-class whites are still far better off than their equivalent black or Hispanic peers. But that is not the barometer for this group. They measure themselves against previous generations, against their own expectations, against the promise of the American dream, and they find it all wanting. It is the relative decline, the sense of failure, the loss of the opportunities they once had, that fuels the sense that things are unraveling. ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1533))
- The siren call of Trump would not work if members of the white working class felt represented in the political process. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1581))
- they believed that he was the person most likely to disrupt the status quo, which had served them so poorly in recent years, and to break the rules they have concluded are unfairly stacked against them.16 ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1626))
- Williamson can talk all he wants about the ignorance, the passivity, and the victimization culture of the white working class, and maybe that is all true, but whatever the legitimacy of those criticisms, we don’t get to shrug off 40 percent of the population without feeling the consequences. ([Location 1641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1641))
- They have faced all this while the cultural elites on both coasts have told them that their values are wrong, the way they talk is offensive, their religion old-fashioned and oppressive, their hobbies gross and antiquated, and, worst of all, their jobs create too many negative externalities. ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1644))
- But it is an amazing leap to take from some isolated cases of data irregularities to a vast global warming conspiracy—a silent handshake between science opportunists, environmental elites that profit from eco-scares, Hollywood elites, and mainstream media who are willing dupes of this manipulation. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1691))
- But of course, that is no insurance policy against us doing it to ourselves. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1702))
- have exaggerated the known effects of climate change; (2) because of the liberal impulse to want to “do something,” they have proposed policies that have little effect on climate change yet impose costs on those least able to afford them; and (3) they have ignored the most obvious sources of remediation that we have, to our collective detriment. ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1948))
- Science indisputably supports global warming but does not currently support the conclusions about apocalyptic outcomes. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1951))
- global warming is not a unique risk, different from other serious problems we need to worry about: overpopulation, global migration, spread of nuclear weapons, or global pandemics, to name just a few. ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=1977))
- the real costs are felt in places like Pikeville, where people face a double-barreled hit: loss of jobs and higher energy costs that they can’t avoid. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2009))
- about 40 percent of the entire planet’s storm surge is recorded in Bangladesh, with tragic results. Cyclones hit the low-lying coast with devastating impact, creating some of the largest natural disasters of the last fifty years. ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2026))
- Climate change is an example of motivated reasoning on both sides of the equation, from those who seek to discredit the science as a way of minimizing government intervention, to those who exaggerate the risks of global warming in order to justify an agenda that is satisfyingly global in scope and bureaucratic in nature. The risks of the former are obvious. Get it wrong and see New York City become a collection of very wet neighborhoods, as imagined by the designer Jeffrey Lind: the Upper East Tide, Little Venice, Middrown, and Hell’s Quicksand. But the risks of the latter are substantial, too: diverting resources from other pressing problems, retarding economic growth to the detriment of those who can least afford it, and, as we will see in the next chapter, ignoring a range of very practical solutions that are irritatingly inconsistent with the progressive narrative. ([Location 2037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2037))
- But the risks of the latter are substantial, too: diverting resources from other pressing problems, retarding economic growth to the detriment of those who can least afford it, and, as we will see in the next chapter, ignoring a range of very practical solutions that are irritatingly inconsistent with the progressive narrative. ([Location 2041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2041))
- is more than faith in science, it is a belief in the scientific method, the process of observation, measurement, and experiment that has defined advanced science since the time of Aristotle. The scientific method is iterative and experimental and by its very nature invites error, but it is also the process that is at the root of advancements that have extended life, taken us into space, and redefined our knowledge of the universe. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2156))
- contrary to popular misconceptions, GM crops are the most extensively tested crops ever added to our food supply. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2211))
- You might shrug this off as “better safe than sorry,” and many do, but that’s not really the case. Real harm is caused by efforts to reduce or eliminate GMOs from the agricultural food supply. GMOs reduce soil damaging tillage, curtail carbon emissions, eliminate the need for some insecticide use, and allow the reduction of the most harmful toxic insecticides in favor of more mild ones. ([Location 2219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2219))
- both parties have a fraught relationship with science and that the current alliance between Democrats and the scientific community operates under a flag of convenience. ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2233))
- The fact that most (though, to be fair, not all) environmentalists portray climate change as an existential threat and still want to shut down fracking and nuclear power strikes me as the height of irresponsibility. ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2305))
- always thought that it was the Democrats who were supposed to stand up for people without power, but it sure doesn’t look that way from Pikeville. ([Location 2431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2431))
- money is green, not red or blue, and like foreign affairs, politics should stop at the water’s edge when it comes to creating opportunity for the poor and the dispossessed. ([Location 2553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2553))
- What has changed is income inequality, which has increased substantially over time, meaning that the rungs of that ladder have moved apart. ([Location 2634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2634))
- Critiquing poverty programs—that’s easy. Fixing them is a different matter. ([Location 2649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2649))
- There are, tragically, families in America that make two dollars a day, and in fact there are even some families that report, at least for some period, no cash income whatsoever.10 But it is also true that below $20 a day per person, American households tend to consume the same amount, regardless of reported cash income, reflecting the matrix of public and private supports that exist outside the cash assistance system. ([Location 2712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2712))
- Doe Fund enrollees are paced through substantial job training long before they are exposed to the private marketplace. ([Location 2747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2747))
- the conservative enthusiasm for work requirements certainly overshadows that for job support. ([Location 2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2752))
- get the federal government and their chosen contractors out of the poverty business; move the money closer to the problem, to communities and community organizations that have greater local knowledge; and give them greater flexibility to solve problems. ([Location 2772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2772))
- the Republican obsession with the wonders of local government may not be exactly foolproof. ([Location 2868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2868))
- Local control, it was argued, would create greater programmatic flexibility and allow for more innovation in helping poor, single mothers find stable jobs. It has not worked out that way: only 8 percent of TANF funding is now spent on work-related supports, and more than a third goes to a grab bag of other services, including after-school programs and college financial aid, that support many families with incomes well above the poverty line. ([Location 2871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2871))
- There is a desperate need in our government for clear-eyed, evidence-based analyses that expose nice-sounding but ineffective programs, ([Location 2892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2892))
- how many rank-and-file Republicans get their news from somewhere beyond Fox, the Wall Street Journal, and Rush Limbaugh. ([Location 2935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2935))
- American political dialogue has always had an angry and deviant voice to it. ([Location 2969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=2969))
- Social media has thus created two seemingly contradictory trends—it has encouraged reckless, often outlandish, public comments and at the same time has imposed groupthink and uniformity of mind. It is one of the greatest puzzles of our time: our views on issues have not changed much, but the language of how we express them and who we are willing to engage with has changed enormously, and not for the better. ([Location 3180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3180))
- By and large, in face-to-face conversations, people typically try to be thoughtful and respectful and open to others. In social media, they are just mostly assholes. ([Location 3184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3184))
- All the net new jobs created since November 2007 have gone to immigrants. Meanwhile, millions of native-born Americans, especially men, have abandoned the job market altogether. The percentage of men aged 25 to 54 who are working or looking for work has dropped to the lowest point in recorded history. ([Location 3321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3321))
- The fact that the educated elites, whose status and economic positioning are not challenged by increased immigration, have tried to enforce a cultural norm supporting immigration and multiculturalism as an unalloyed good—and that objections to it must come from some latent racism—has not helped matters terribly much. ([Location 3325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3325))
- open trade with China has cost the United States some 2.4 million manufacturing jobs. ([Location 3335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3335))
- local labor markets have proven to be “remarkably slow” to create compensating work for those who had lost their livelihood. ([Location 3336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3336))
- no political party in America represents the working class ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3344))
- The Democratic Party, the historic political partner to labor, has long since abdicated that role, in favor of representing an unwieldy coalition of urban elites, racial minorities, and social interest groups. ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3344))
- It is to the shame of the Democrats that they have lost their voice on the matter, though it is rather ironic that it is the Republicans, the ones who sabotaged many worker protections in the first place, who found an appealing tone for the moment. ([Location 3349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3349))
- the Republican Party, at least for now, has become not a party of ideas but a party of grievances. That would be fine if the Republicans had any prospects for resolving those grievances, but the early days of this administration strongly suggest otherwise. ([Location 3362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3362))
- We have all convinced ourselves of the inerrancy of our own political views. And we have also convinced ourselves not only that the other side is wrong, but that their wrongfulness comes from a place of greed or poor morals or rank stupidity. ([Location 3373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3373))
- the vast majority of Americans don’t have tidy views, and in fact participate in a strong cross-party consensus that the issue is complicated, there is truth on both sides, and the right answer is really a balancing of equities. ([Location 3507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NC052Y7&location=3507))
