- Category: #books

## Highlights
- They include pessimism about the way the world is heading, cynicism about the institutions of modernity, and an inability to conceive of a higher purpose in anything other than religion. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=226))
- reason tells you that none of this is particular to you, you have the responsibility to provide to others what you expect for yourself. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=284))
- You can foster the welfare of other sentient beings by enhancing life, health, knowledge, freedom, abundance, safety, beauty, and peace. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=285))
- History shows that when we sympathize with others and apply our ingenuity to improving the human condition, we can make progress in doing so, and you can help to continue that progress. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=286))
- “If old truths are to retain their hold on men’s minds, they must be restated in the language and concepts of successive generations” ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=317))
- Optimism (in the sense that I have advocated) is the theory that all failures—all evils—are due to insufficient knowledge. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=339))
- Some problems are hard, but it is a mistake to confuse hard problems with problems unlikely to be solved. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=341))
- the Enlightenment hope for progress was concentrated on human institutions. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=436))
- Cruel punishments, whether or not they are in some sense “deserved,” are no more effective at deterring harm than moderate but surer punishments, and they desensitize spectators and brutalize the society that implements them. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=448))
- Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an effective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them, and other people are more valuable to you alive than dead. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=463))
- Now order could be characterized in terms of the set of all microscopically distinct states of a system (in the original example involving heat, the possible speeds and positions of all the molecules in the two bodies). Of all these states, the ones that we find useful from a bird’s-eye view (such as one body being hotter than the other, which translates into the average speed of the molecules in one body being higher than the average speed in the other) make up a tiny fraction of the possibilities, while all the disorderly or useless states (the ones without a temperature difference, in which the average speeds in the two bodies are the same) make up the vast majority. It follows that any perturbation of the system, whether it is a random jiggling of its parts or a whack from the outside, will, by the laws of probability, nudge the system toward disorder or uselessness—not because nature strives for disorder, but because there are so many more ways of being disorderly than of being orderly. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=497))
- Life and happiness depend on an infinitesimal sliver of orderly arrangements of matter amid the astronomical number of possibilities. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=508))
- when things change without a human agent directing the change, they are likely to change for the worse. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=511))
- to deploy energy and knowledge to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=532))
- Even the fleshy outer ear—asymmetrical top to bottom and front to back, and crinkled with ridges and valleys—is shaped in a way ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=554))
- that sculpts the incoming sound to inform the brain whether the soundmaker is above or below, in front or behind. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=555))
- Some physicists enshrine information as one of the basic constituents of the universe, together with matter and energy. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=597))
- Not only does the universe not care about our desires, but in the natural course of events it will appear to thwart them, because there are so many more ways for things to go wrong than for them to go right. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=688))

- the advantages either of us might get in harming the other are massively outweighed by the disadvantages we would suffer in being harmed ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=763))
- (yet another implication of the Law of Entropy: harms are easier to inflict and have larger effects than benefits). ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=764))
- We’d be wiser to negotiate a social contract that puts us in a positive-sum game: neither gets to harm the other, and both are encouraged to help the other. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=765))
- norms and institutions that channel parochial interests into universal benefits. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=767))
- Nationalism should not be confused with civic values, public spirit, social responsibility, or cultural pride. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=814))
- it is genuinely admirable for one individual to sacrifice his or her interests for those of many individuals. It’s quite another thing when a person is forced to make the supreme sacrifice for the benefit of a charismatic leader, a square of cloth, or colors on a map. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=817))
- the left was sympathetic to nationalism when it was fused with Marxist liberation movements. And many on the left encourage identity politicians and social justice warriors who downplay individual rights in favor of equalizing the standing of races, classes, and genders, which they see as being pitted in zero-sum competition. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=823))
- Left-wing and right-wing political ideologies have themselves become secular religions, providing people with a community of like-minded brethren, a catechism of sacred beliefs, a well-populated demonology, and a beatific confidence in the righteousness of their cause. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=840))
- Apparently the world has been coming to an end for a long time indeed. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=849))
- Their methodology for seeking the truth consists not in framing hypotheses and citing evidence but in issuing pronouncements that draw on their breadth of erudition and lifetime habits of reading. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=890))
- It’s the idea of progress that rankles the chattering class—the Enlightenment belief that by understanding the world we can improve the human condition. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=914))
- Optimism Gap. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=938))
- Availability errors are a common source of folly in human reasoning. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=975))
- how can we soundly appraise the state of the world? The answer is to count. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=996))
- A quantitative mindset, despite its nerdy aura, is in fact the morally enlightened one, because it treats every human life as having equal value rather than privileging the people who are closest to us or most photogenic. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=998))
- Progress cannot always be monotonic because solutions to problems create new problems.18 But progress can resume when the new problems are solved in their turn. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1026))
- If you ignore all the years in which an indicator of some problem declines, and report every uptick (since, after all, it’s “news”), readers will come away with the impression that life is getting worse and worse even as it gets better and better. ([Location 1029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1029))
- If you see that a pile of laundry has gone down, it does not mean the clothes washed themselves; it means someone washed the clothes. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1048))
- to look at data showing that violence has gone down and say “Violence has gone down” is to describe a fact. To look at data showing that violence has gone down and say “Violence has gone up” is to be delusional. To ignore data on violence and say “Violence has gone up” is to be a know-nothing. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1053))
- “The most important of all limitations on knowledge-creation is that we cannot prophesy: we cannot predict the content of ideas yet to be created, or their effects. This limitation is not only consistent with the unlimited growth of knowledge, it is entailed by it.” ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1069))
- Two other illusions mislead us into thinking that things ain’t what they used to be: we mistake the growing burdens of maturity and parenthood for a less innocent world, and we mistake a decline in our own faculties for a decline in the times.25 As the columnist Franklin Pierce Adams pointed out, “Nothing is more responsible for the good old days than a bad memory.” ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1111))
- “Always predict the worst, and you’ll be hailed as a prophet,” ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1124))
- The financial writer Morgan Housel has observed that while pessimists sound like they’re trying to help you, optimists sound like they’re trying to sell you something. ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1129))
- As we care about more of humanity, we’re apt to mistake the harms around us for signs of how low the world has sunk rather than how high our standards have risen. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1144))
- One consequence is that many Americans today have difficulty imagining, valuing or even believing in the promise of incremental system change, which leads to a greater appetite for revolutionary, smash-the-machine change. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1151))
- here is a shocker: The world has made spectacular progress in every single measure of human well-being. Here is a second shocker: Almost no one knows about it. ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1185))
- (None was recognized with a major prize, but over the period in which they appeared, Pulitzers in nonfiction were given to four books on genocide, three on terrorism, two on cancer, two on racism, and one on extinction.) ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1193))
- Medical progress today is more Sisyphus than Singularity. ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1343))
- Among the brainchildren of the Enlightenment is the realization that wealth is created. ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1727))
- when an important good becomes plentiful, it costs far less than what people are willing to pay for it. The difference is called consumer surplus, ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1765))
- capture the price of everything but the value of nothing. ([Location 1767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1767))
- “In 1976,” Radelet writes, “Mao single-handedly and dramatically changed the direction of global poverty with one simple act: he died.” ([Location 1910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1910))
- To varying degrees, their governments invested in education, public health, infrastructure, and agricultural and job training, together with social insurance and poverty-reduction programs. ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1931))
- rather than a mandate to enhance the well-being of their citizens. ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=1938))
- “From the point of view of morality, it is not important everyone should have the same. What is morally important is that each should have enough.” ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2097))
- (which is not to say that every rich person has made people better off). ([Location 2115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2115))
    - Note: Indeed. And what about taxation of this immense wealth? 
      With great wealth comes great responsibility.
- unequal societies make people feel that they are pitted in a winner-take-all competition for dominance, and the stress makes them sick and self-destructive. ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2137))
- Inequality is seen as a harbinger of opportunity, a sign that education and other routes to upward mobility might pay off for them and their children. ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2155))
- the conflation of inequality with unfairness. ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2159))
- Narratives about the causes of inequality loom larger in people’s minds than the existence of inequality. ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2167))
- Economic inequality, then, is not itself a dimension of human well-being, and it should not be confused with unfairness or with poverty. ([Location 2179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2179))
- (Another way of putting it is that a market economy maximizes the average, but we also care about the variance and the range.) ([Location 2258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2258))
- The United States is famously resistant to anything smacking of redistribution. Yet it allocates 19 percent of its GDP to social services, ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2293))
- social spending in the United States is even higher than it appears, because many Americans are forced to pay for health, retirement, and disability benefits through their employers rather than the government. When this privately administered social spending is added to the public portion, the United States vaults from twenty-fourth into second place among the thirty-five OECD countries, just behind France. ([Location 2296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2296))
- In Canada the top two national pastimes (after hockey) are complaining about their health care system and boasting about their health care system. ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2305))
- The elephant’s bulk (its body and head), which includes about seven-tenths of the world’s population, consists of the “emerging global middle class,” mainly in Asia. Over this period they saw cumulative gains of 40 to 60 percent in their real incomes. The nostrils at the tip of the trunk consist of the world’s richest one percent, who also saw their incomes soar. The rest of the trunk tip, which includes the next 4 percent down, didn’t do badly either. Where the bend of the trunk hovers over the floor around the 85th percentile we see globalization’s “losers”: the lower middle classes of the rich world, who gained less than 10 percent. ([Location 2348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2348))
- People move in and out of income brackets, shuffling the order, so we’re not necessarily talking about the same individuals. ([Location 2366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2366))
- The rich certainly have prospered more than anyone else, perhaps more than they should have, but the claim about everyone else is not accurate, for a number of reasons. ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2376))
- The first is the difference between relative and absolute prosperity. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2396))
- Inequality undoubtedly increased—the rich got richer faster than the poor and middle class got richer—but everyone (on average) got richer. ([Location 2405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2405))
- The second confusion is the one between anonymous and longitudinal data. ([Location 2406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2406))
- a majority of Americans believe that the standard of living of the middle class has declined in recent years but that their own standard of living has improved. ([Location 2414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2414))
- A third reason that rising inequality has not made the lower classes worse off is that low incomes have been mitigated by social transfers. ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2416))
- A dollar today, no matter how heroically adjusted for inflation, buys far more betterment of life than a dollar yesterday. ([Location 2458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2458))
- The rich have gotten richer, but their lives haven’t gotten that much better. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2469))
- Education, a major driver of economic mobility, is not keeping up with the demands of modern economies: tertiary education has soared in cost (defying the inexpensification of almost every other good), and in poor American neighborhoods, primary and secondary education are unconscionably substandard. ([Location 2485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2485))
- Ecomodernism begins with the realization that some degree of pollution is an inescapable consequence of the ([Location 2568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2568))
- Second Law of Thermodynamics. ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2569))
- industrialization has been good for humanity. ([Location 2588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=2588))
- economic growth is not synonymous with burning carbon. ([Location 3006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3006))
- We cannot be complacently optimistic about climate change, but we can be conditionally optimistic. ([Location 3235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3235))
- Accidents are the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease, cancer, and respiratory diseases. ([Location 3467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3467))
- So complex, in fact, that treating the symptoms may be the best way of dealing with the problem, because it does not require omniscience about the intricate tissue of actual causes. ([Location 3519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3519))
- Forget root causes. Stay close to the symptoms—the neighborhoods and individuals responsible for the biggest wedges of violence—and chip away at the incentives and opportunities that drive them. ([Location 3583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3583))
- While the threat of ever-harsher punishments is both cheap and emotionally satisfying, ([Location 3607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3607))
- it’s not particularly effective, because scofflaws just treat them like rare accidents—horrible, yes, but a risk that comes with the job. Punishments that are predictable, even if less draconian, are likelier to be factored into day-to-day choices. ([Location 3608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3608))
- Cheap consumer goods are another development that has turned weak-willed delinquents into law-abiding citizens despite themselves. ([Location 3636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3636))
- Neither right-to-carry laws favored by the right, nor bans and restrictions favored by the left, have been shown to make much difference—though ([Location 3651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3651))
- After car crashes, the likeliest cause of accidental death consists of falls, followed by drownings and fires, followed by poisonings. ([Location 3748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3748))
- A typical firefighter will see just one burning building every other year. ([Location 3774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3774))
- Though we sometimes chafe at the false alarms and the nanny-state intrusions, we get to enjoy the blessings of technology without the threats to life and limb. ([Location 3906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3906))
- (Among the categories of accident that typically kill more than 44 people in a given year are “Lightning,” “Contact with hot tap water,” “Contact with hornets, wasps, and bees,” “Bitten or struck by mammals other than dogs,” “Drowning and submersion while in or falling into bathtub,” and “Ignition or melting of clothing and apparel other than nightwear.”) ([Location 3959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3959))
- violence that used to be called “insurgency” or “guerrilla warfare” is now often classified as “terrorism.” ([Location 3974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=3974))
- Indeed, the rise of terrorism in public awareness is not a sign of how dangerous the world has become but the opposite. ([Location 4049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4049))
- One can think of democracy as a form of government that threads the needle, exerting just enough force to prevent people from preying on each other without preying on the people itself. A good democratic government allows people to pursue their lives in safety, protected from the violence of anarchy, and in freedom, protected from the violence of tyranny. ([Location 4096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4096))
- Of the people living in the 60 nondemocratic countries today (20 full autocracies, 40 more autocratic than democratic), four-fifths reside in a single country, China. ([Location 4169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4169))
- repeatedly astonished by the shallowness and incoherence of people’s political beliefs, and by the tenuous connection of their preferences to their votes and to the behavior of their representatives. ([Location 4192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4192))
- Their opinions flip depending on how a question is worded: ([Location 4195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4195))
- Many political scientists have concluded that most people correctly recognize that their votes are astronomically unlikely to affect the outcome of an election, and so they prioritize work, family, and leisure over educating themselves about politics and calibrating their votes. ([Location 4201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4201))
- democracy should be understood not as the answer to the question “Who should rule?” (namely, “The People”), but as a solution to the problem of how to dismiss bad leadership without bloodshed. ([Location 4214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4214))
- Democracy, he suggests, is essentially based on giving people the freedom to complain: “It comes about when the people effectively agree not to use violence to replace the leadership, and the leadership leaves them free to try to dislodge it by any other means.” ([Location 4217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4217))
- Women’s suffrage is an example: by definition, they could not vote to grant themselves the vote, but they got it by other means. ([Location 4224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4224))
- The front line in democratization, then, is constraining the government from abusing its monopoly on force to brutalize its uppity citizens. ([Location 4245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4245))
- if the current rate of abolition continues (not that he’s prophesying it will), capital punishment will vanish from the face of the earth by 2026. ([Location 4291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4291))
- The American death penalty is not so much being abolished as falling apart, piece by piece. ([Location 4340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4340))
- Those without the capital get the punishment”), ([Location 4352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=4352))
- Trump’s success, like that of right-wing populists in other Western countries, is better understood as the mobilization of an aggrieved and shrinking demographic in a polarized political landscape than as the sudden reversal of a century-long movement toward equal rights.

When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their speech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on the other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not certainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more readily admitted it and changed their minds.47 ([Location 7383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073TJBYTB&location=7383))

- An endorsement of scientific thinking must first of all be distinguished from any belief that members of the occupational guild called “science” are particularly wise or noble. The culture of science is based on the opposite belief. Its signature practices, including open debate, peer review, and double-blind methods, are designed to circumvent the sins to which scientists, being human, are vulnerable.
