## Highlights
- Your DNA is simply an instruction manual for making you. A length of DNA is divided into segments called chromosomes and shorter individual units called genes. The sum of all your genes is the genome. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=224))
- What genes specifically do is provide instructions for building proteins. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=237))
- Most of the useful things in the body are proteins. Some speed up chemical changes and are known as enzymes. Others convey chemical messages and are known as hormones. Still others attack pathogens and are called antibodies. The largest of all our proteins is called titin, which helps to control muscle elasticity. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=237))
- Every day, it has been estimated, between one and five of your cells turn cancerous, and your immune system captures and kills them. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=263))
- Silently and remorselessly we turn to dust. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=310))
- “People act as if skin color is a determinant of character when all it is is a reaction to sunlight. Biologically, there is actually no such thing as race—nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure, or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=347))
- Its production slows dramatically as we age, which is why older people’s hair tends to turn gray. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=362))
- The red of sunburn is because the tiny blood vessels in the affected areas become engorged with blood, making the skin hot to the touch. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=380))
- We are actually as hairy as our cousins the apes. It’s just that our hair is much wispier and fainter. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=421))
- known formally as horripilation but more commonly as getting goose bumps. In furry mammals, it adds a useful layer of insulating air between the hair and the skin, but in humans it has absolutely no physiological benefit ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=427))
- Hair on the head acts as a good insulator in cold weather and a good reflector of heat in hot weather. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=435))
- We each grow about twenty-five feet of hair in a lifetime, but because all hair falls out at some point, no single strand can ever get longer than about three feet. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=448))
- “The loss of most of our body hair and the gain of the ability to dissipate excess body heat through eccrine sweating helped to make possible the dramatic enlargement of our most temperature-sensitive organ, the brain.” That, she says, is how sweat helped to make you brainy. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=489))
- Unlike the rest of the body, the palms don’t sweat in response to physical exertion or heat, but only from stress. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=506))
- To make one’s hands safely clean after a medical examination requires thorough washing with soap and water for at least a full minute—a standard that is, in practical terms, all but unattainable for anyone dealing with lots of patients. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=518))
- Studies of scratching showed that the most prolonged relief comes from scratching the back but the most pleasurable relief comes from scratching the ankle. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=542))
- She had scratched through the skull bone and into her own brain. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=549))
- What is most puzzling is that she has destroyed virtually all the nerve fibers in that patch of skin, yet the maddening itch remains. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=551))
- About 60 percent of men are “substantially bald” by the age of fifty. One man in five achieves that condition by thirty. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=554))
- a hormone called dihydrotestosterone tends to go slightly haywire as we age, directing hair follicles on the head to shut down and more reserved ones in the nostrils and ears to spring to dismaying life. The one known cure for baldness is castration. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=556))
- A single parent bacterium could in theory produce a mass of offspring greater than the weight of Earth in less than two days. In three days, its progeny would exceed the mass of the observable universe. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=590))
- the microbe heap would be twenty-five times greater than the animal one. Make no mistake. This is a planet of microbes. We are here at their pleasure. They don’t need us at all. We’d be dead in a day without them. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=593))
- (Thin people have more gut microbes than fat people; having hungry microbes may at least partly account for their thinness.) ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=602))
- Altogether your private load of microbes weighs roughly three pounds, about the same as your brain. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=604))
- thirty trillion human cells and between thirty and fifty trillion bacterial cells ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=608))
- that 85 percent of our own cells are red blood cells, which aren’t true cells at all, because they don’t have any of the usual machinery of cells (like nuclei and mitochondria), but are really just containers for hemoglobin. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=609))
- bacterial cells are tiny, whereas human cells are comparatively gigantic, ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=611))
- twenty thousand genes of your own within you, but perhaps as many as twenty million bacterial genes, ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=613))
- Although you and I will each have several thousand bacterial species within us, we may have only a fraction in common. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=616))
- Most of the time, they are as lifeless as a mote of dust, but put them into a living cell, and they will burst into animate existence and reproduce as furiously as any living thing. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=640))
- They are also terribly small—much smaller than bacteria and too small to be seen under conventional microscopes. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=643))
- most viruses infect only bacterial cells and have no effect on us at all. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=650))
- Colds unquestionably are more frequent in winter than in summer, but that may only be because we spend more time indoors then and are more exposed to others’ leakages and exhalations. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=672))
- The common cold is not a single illness but rather a family of symptoms generated by a multiplicity of viruses, of which the most pernicious are the rhinoviruses. These alone come in a hundred varieties. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=673))
- The only really reliable way to transfer cold germs is physically by touch. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=688))
- Fungi for a long time were a kind of scientific bewilderment, classified as just slightly strange plants. In fact, at a cellular level, they aren’t very like plants at all. They don’t photosynthesize, so they have no chlorophyll and thus are not green. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=694))
- In fact, at a cellular level, they aren’t very like plants at all. They don’t photosynthesize, so they have no chlorophyll and thus are not green. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=695))
- Altogether fungi are thought to be responsible for about a million deaths globally every year, so hardly inconsequential. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=710))
- A protist is anything that isn’t obviously plant, animal, or fungus; it is a category reserved for all those life-forms that don’t fit anywhere else. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=711))
- Every bit of penicillin made since that day is descended from that single random cantaloupe. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=792))
- The British discoverers found to their chagrin that the production methods had been patented by the Americans and that they were now required to pay royalties to make use of their own discovery. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=794))
- That’s partly why babies sleep all the time—their growing brains exhaust them—and have a lot of body fat, to use as an energy reserve when needed. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=921))
- Each neuron connects with thousands of other neurons, giving trillions and trillions of connections—as many connections “in a single cubic centimeter of brain tissue as there are stars in the Milky Way,” ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=937))
- Your nightmares may simply be the amygdalae unburdening themselves. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=988))
    - Note: From footnote:
      You have two of both, so they really should be referred to in the plural, but rarely are.
- To help us deal better with this fractional lag, the brain does a truly extraordinary thing: it continuously forecasts what the world will be like a fifth of a second from now, and that is what it gives us as the present. That means that we never see the world as it is at this very instant, but rather as it will be a fraction of a moment in the future. We spend our whole lives, in other words, living in a world that doesn’t quite exist yet. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1009))
- What you see is not what is but what your brain tells you it is, ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1021))
- Consider a bar of soap. Has it ever struck you that soap lather is always white no matter what color the soap is? That isn’t because the soap somehow changes color when it is moistened and rubbed. Molecularly, it’s exactly as it was before. It’s just that the foam reflects light in a different way. You get the same effect with crashing waves on a beach—greeny-blue water, white foam—and lots of other phenomena. That is because color isn’t a fixed reality but a perception. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1021))
- Now, however, it is thought that the stimulation was mostly providing the sensation of memory and that what the patients were experiencing was more like a hallucination than a recalled event. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1087))
- A teenager’s brain is only about 80 percent finished ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1125))
- Although most of the growth of the brain occurs in the first two years and is 95 percent completed by the age of ten, the synapses aren’t fully wired until a young person is in his or her mid- to late twenties. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1126))
- That is why the sensations you feel as a teenager are more intense than at any other time of life. ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1133))
- The remaining third of his brain had simply taken on the duties and functions of the missing two-thirds and had done it so well that neither he nor anyone else had ever suspected that he was operating at a much-reduced capacity. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1150))
- Paradoxically, the very fact that the brain is so snugly encased in its protective skull leaves it susceptible to damage when it swells from infection or when fluid is added to it, ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1210))
- “The history of epilepsy can be summarised as 4,000 years of ignorance, superstition and stigma followed by 100 years of knowledge, superstition and stigma.” ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1225))
- a genuine, spontaneous smile involves the contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle in each eye, and we have no independent control over those muscles. You can make your mouth smile, but you can’t make your eyes sparkle with feigned joy. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1367))
- One of the reasons the Mona Lisa looks enigmatic is that she has no eyebrows. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1382))
- The chin is unique to humans, and no one knows why we have one. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1392))
- Altogether (and depending on how you count them) we have as many as thirty-three systems within us that let us know where we are and how we are doing. ([Location 1399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1399))
- What you are seeing, amazingly enough, is your own white blood cells, moving through a capillary in front of the retina. ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1409))
- They are clumps of microscopic fibers in the jellylike vitreous humor of your eye, which cast a shadow on the retina. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1414))
- The lens, which gets all the credit in the popular mind, does only about a third of the focusing. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1426))
- Tears not only keep our eyelids gliding smoothly but also even out tiny imperfections on the eyeball surface, making focused vision possible. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1433))
- We are the only creatures that cry from feeling, as far as we can tell. ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1436))
- Our scleras are unique among primates. They allow us to monitor the gazes of others with considerable precision, as well as to communicate silently. ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1449))
- People who are “color-blind” normally lack one of the three types of cones, so they don’t see all the colors, just some of them. ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1453))
- People who have no cones at all, and are genuinely color-blind, are called achromatopes. ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1454))
- but virtually all nonmammalian creatures live in a visually richer world than we do. ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1458))
- But because your eye is constantly darting—taking four snapshots every second—you have the impression of seeing a much broader area. ([Location 1462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1462))
- A pressure wave that moves the eardrum by less ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1500))
- than the width of an atom will activate the ossicles and reach the brain as sound. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1500))
- “If we could hear quieter sounds still, we would live in a world of continuous noise, because the omnipresent random motion of air molecules would be audible. Our hearing really could not get any better.” ([Location 1501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1501))
- From the quietest detectable sound to the loudest is a range of about a million million times of amplitude. ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1503))
- To help protect us from the damage of really loud noises, we have something called an acoustic reflex, in which a muscle jerks the stapes away from the cochlea, essentially breaking the circuit, whenever a brutally intense sound is perceived, and it maintains that posture for some seconds afterward, which is why we are often deafened after an explosion. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1504))
- Volume doubles about every 6 decibels, ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1517))
- The pain threshold for noise is about 120 decibels, and noises above 150 decibels can burst the eardrum. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1518))
- That gel thickens as we age and doesn’t slosh around as well, which is one reason why the elderly are often not so steady on their feet ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1527))
- When loss of balance is prolonged or severe, the brain doesn’t know quite what to make of it and interprets it as poisoning. That is why loss of balance so generally results in nausea. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1528))
- it is the only one of the five basic senses not mediated by the hypothalamus. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1572))
- When we smell something, the information, for reasons unknown, goes straight to the olfactory cortex, which is nestled close to the hippocampus, where memories are shaped, and it is thought by some neuroscientists that that may explain why certain odors are so powerfully evocative of memories for us. ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1573))
- The heart is not really one pump but two: one that sends blood to the lungs and one that sends it around the body. ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1953))
- Curiously, the blood passing through the chambers of the heart does nothing for the heart itself. The oxygen that nourishes it arrives via the coronary arteries, in exactly the way oxygen reaches other organs. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1956))
- To contract, however, they need to be in motion. That’s why it’s important to get up and move around regularly. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1965))
- When heart muscle downstream of a blockage is deprived of oxygen, it begins to die, usually within about sixty minutes. Any heart muscle we lose in this way is gone forever, which is a bit galling when you consider that other creatures much simpler than we are—zebra fish, for instance—can regrow damaged heart tissue. Why evolution deprived us of this useful facility is yet another of the body’s many imponderables. ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=1998))
- You discard about a hundred billion red blood cells every day. They are a big component of what makes your stools brown. (Bilirubin, a by-product of the same process, is responsible for the golden glow of urine as well as the yellow blush of fading bruises.) ([Location 2165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2165))
- The liver is a gland and it is, compared with the rest of our glands, gigantic. When fully grown, it weighs about 3.3 pounds, roughly the same as the brain, and fills much of the central abdomen just below the diaphragm. It is disproportionately large in infants, which is why their bellies are so delightfully rounded. ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2559))
- about a quarter of all your blood is in your liver. ([Location 2568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2568))
- You can remove two-thirds of a liver and it will grow back to its original size in just a few weeks. ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2569))
- When we talk today of humoring someone or of people being ill-humored, we are not talking about their capacity for laughter, at least not etymologically. ([Location 2591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2591))
- Apart from anything else, it could help to explain the long-standing mystery of how regular exercise helps to stave off Alzheimer’s disease: exercise builds stronger bones and stronger bones produce more osteocalcin. ([Location 2810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2810))
- “Bone is also the only tissue in the body that doesn’t scar,” Ben adds. “If you break your leg, after it heals you cannot tell where the break was. ([Location 2823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2823))
- Because muscle is so expensive to maintain, we sacrifice muscle tone really quickly when we are not using ([Location 2844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2844))
- What we do have in our thumbs are three small but resplendently named muscles not found in any other animals, ([Location 2860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2860))
- Working together, they allow us to grasp and manipulate tools with sureness and delicacy. ([Location 2863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2863))
- Because cartilage isn’t nourished by blood, the best thing you can do to maintain it is to move around a lot, to keep the cartilage bathed in its own synovial fluid. ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2911))
- About 40 percent of people over seventy-five who break their hips are no longer able to care for themselves. ([Location 2928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2928))
- Ten percent die within thirty days, and nearly 30 percent die within twelve months. ([Location 2929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2929))
- No ape can be trained to walk like a human. They are compelled by their bone structure to waddle, and to do so in a most inefficient way. A chimpanzee uses four times as much energy to move around at ground level as does a human. ([Location 2967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2967))
- The changes to our upper anatomy left us by happy accident with vocal tracts uniquely able to make articulate speech. Walking and talking probably went hand in hand. ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2976))
- It is the nuchal ligament, and it has just one job: to hold the head steady when running. And running—serious, dogged, long-distance running—is the one thing we do superlatively well. ([Location 2979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2979))
- That our ancestors could also organize themselves into hunting parties, to harry quarry from different sides or drive prey into confined spaces, made us all the more effective. ([Location 2984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=2984))
- it also means that we dislocate our shoulders easily. ([Location 3000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=3000))
- The ability to wound and torment exhausted prey with rocks from a relatively safe distance must have been a highly useful skill among early hunters. ([Location 3004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M82PNSX&location=3004))
