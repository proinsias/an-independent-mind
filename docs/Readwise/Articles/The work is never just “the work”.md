# The work is never just “the work”

## Highlights
- There were two common threads:
  • much of the work was the “work to do the work” rather than the “actual” work
  • most of the work was under- or un-estimated because it wasn’t the “actual” work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h215r5w8d4arzqq59ek8w8wm))
- Analogy Real world The work around the work ***Admin*** 
  Meetings, reviews, project management, etc The work to get the work ***Acquisition*** 
  Research, experimentation, scoping, quoting, pitching The work before the work ***Preparation*** 
  Configuration, setup, services, infrastructure The work ***Execution*** 
  The actual build, product, design, etc The work between the work ***Iteration*** 
  Iteration, debugging, refactoring, maintenance, tooling The work beyond the work ***Changes*** 
  Changes, omissions, nice-to-haves, scope creep The work outside the work ***Problems*** 
  Surprises, contingency, disasters, mission creep The work after the work ***Support*** 
  Hosting, deployment, security, support, updates, fixes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h215xezxttqt01pgpxynga8g))
- Without a proper audit it is impossible to properly quantify how long work takes over the longer term, but given the breakdowns above “double it and double it again” doesn’t seem so farfetched; at the very least it makes a good first marker to sanity-check your next estimation, be it a sprint or a project. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h215zccpgh0psacsdpten7sg))
- Some strategies and thoughts going forward:
  • Run postmortems on past projects to anchor yourself to reality
  • Consider timing and logging future work to equip yourself for the future
  • Get familiar with, and work to improve, your own estimation biases and weak spots
  • Remember every project *will* have *most* of these invisible “work” types
  • If you end up in trouble, prefer “raising a hand” to “doubling down”
  • Beware fixed-price projects! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h215zqndfyjerhx76fc31cmb))
