## Highlights
- Andreessen invests in technological revolutions, so he has little incentive to do anything but hype them up ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8bj0vv2w9y41h4v3vqfmz))
- This seemingly innocuous parallel with human thinking, much like the phrase “artificial intelligence” itself, elides the vast gulf in capability between human minds and the current state of machine learning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8ccvfadpnnczyfqwpt4c3))
- Large language models (LLMs) are statistical inference algorithms. They predict the next likeliest thing in a sequence of things, such as words in a sentence. They produce what looks very much like human writing because they’ve been trained on vast quantities of human writing to predict what a human would write. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8e1425d63sgd2hmnd8y4m))
- this is not even remotely similar to how you “understand, synthesize and generate knowledge.” You, like every human, have learned about the world by directly interacting with it. You’ve developed conceptions of physical objects such as trees and tables, of abstractions such as poverty and ethics, and of other people’s thoughts and feelings. You’ve learned to use language to talk about and process those conceptions, but language is just a layer for you, a way to share and refine your mental picture of the world. For LLMs, there is no mental picture; language is all there is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8d92zysn6x3br41thbdcq))
- There are two key blind spots here. First is the assumption that these AI sidekicks will be“infinitely knowledgeable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8fdvae4gs3n98edn6bvdq))
- More troubling the assumption that humans would use even a far superior AI to make “better” decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8fr58dss7wbgwhdevgg7c))
- If, as Andreessen insists, programming AI to have certain values is off the table, then all an AI coach will do is help humans get better at making the world whatever they make it, which… well, take a look around you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8gwq3vz0ht91trae0pzk8))
- When companies become more productive, they don’t pass savings on to customers unless they’re forced to by competition or regulation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8j5k2r0art6sx6ad5ktgx))
- large companies are more likely than smaller ones both to have the technical resources to implement AI and to see a meaningful benefit from doing so ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8jnaxsh0k0wyy6vgrm424))
- AI may even reduce competition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8jw5sjyf9p2w6yfgxa08b))
- while technology may make *companies* more productive, it only sometimes makes individual *workers* more productive (so-called marginal productivity). Other times, it just allows companies to automate part of the work and employ fewer people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8k8f7djatj99q8c98f5hm))
- For example, take supermarket self-checkout kiosks. These don’t make the remaining checkout staff more productive; nor do they help the supermarket get more shoppers or sell more goods. They merely allow it to let go of some staff. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8ks14qhspxx1tanwskmkk))
- Plenty of technological advances *can* improve marginal productivity, but—the book argues—whether they *do* depends on how companies choose to implement them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e8m1fj4j909p2cjff5y6cw))
