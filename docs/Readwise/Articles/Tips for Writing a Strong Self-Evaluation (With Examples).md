## Highlights
- Include specific examples of any skills learned or goals met. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w342jxf68c7q5ke7ecvgy2))
- consider your metrics of success for your own performance — whether that’s a quantitative measure like KPIs and OKRs, or more qualitative, such as your emotions and feelings about the last year. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w38wfj3z73aeetd580884z))
- Make sure you write down specific examples of any skills learned, goals met, or targets hit, so that you’re well-prepared for the next performance review cycle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w390gp25dq2v5kaj549gh3))
- For each goal, evaluate yourself based on the following questions:
  • Why did you meet — or struggle to meet — this goal?
  • When you didn’t meet a goal, what blockers made progress difficult?
  • Was this goal clear, specific, and challenging enough? Why?
  • Thinking about the goals you struggled to meet, what could you improve on to meet goals like this in future?
  • Thinking about the goals you achieved, how can you build on this success to set a new goal? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w39c9t41ed5r57v5bep2af))
- Evaluate your progress by considering the following questions:
  • How have you helped team members and peers deliver on their goals?
  • Were there any specific instances or projects where team members praised your contributions?
  • How have you followed through on team expectations?
  • How would you rate your teamwork and collaboration skills? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w41z6399ayz6nn71qrt808))
- To get started, use your job description as a guide. Evaluate how you meet each of the core competencies and skill sets, pointing to specific examples when you demonstrated each. While you write, work through the following topics:
  • **Role in the wider team:** How does your work connect to the bigger picture? What kind of teammate are you?
  • **Unique selling point:** What do you contribute that sets you apart? How is your team unable to function without you?
  • **Key results:** Review any OKRs. What key results did or didn’t you achieve? Why or why not?
  • **Areas for improvement:** Things can change for the better after a performance evaluation. What does that look like for you? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w436b58418a1cdjgyzm3vf))
- Talk about the cause and effect of your actions on projects, and make sure to reference praise you’ve gotten from others. Include business outcomes, quotes from happy customers, and any tangible data. Talk assertively about your accomplishments like they’re facts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w44fgtre4pp0cyj0t2ss8k))
- When talking about any areas for improvement, focus on honesty, and try not to be defensive, minimize errors, or blame others in your self-evaluation. Remember that everything you say is from your own perspective, so it’s a good practice to phrase things accordingly, such as “I found out I benefit from x”, or “I found I work best in x conditions”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w468ebp6x0z599s0pnemfr))
- When talking about mistakes or known problems during the review period, stay positive and emphasize the solution and next steps. You want to position yourself as a problem-solver with self-awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1w46jx5r25re2np4a0bhvxp))
