## Highlights
- what really haunts leaders on a day-to-day basis is the mistakes that they make. They don’t trip up because they are bad people; they most often fumble because of a lack of knowledge, bad habits, or too much stress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2eg3dzvjg0jmz0wzf1vbe))
- Not taking time to bond with people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2ejxtqr1vaws68wv3pxf5))
- you do have to get to know who the person is and understand what motivates them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2es9mh06t9jprggkcw3fw))
- It can be achieved through non-verbal communication like smiling, using eye contact, or paying attention to your tone of voice, or verbally by giving appropriate compliments or praise. It means finding opportunities to interact with your team members beyond purely just dealing with the task at hand by asking questions or displaying behavior that shows you are interested in them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2ez63bmdsfvd65mdspdrz))
- Being unavailable and inaccessible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2f4s47jp6vya6r3q09scv))
- Leaders who assign tasks and walk away with a completely hands off approach abandon their people. Good delegation relies on signaling a willingness to remain connected and available. That doesn’t mean that you have to respond to every small request straightaway. It does mean, however, that you’ve created channels for people to reach you as well as guidelines for using those channels.

- Not focusing on developing talent ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2ft7d7q9qf8pdfnq7713a))
- Too often, leaders focus exclusively on achieving company goals, and in that push deny the inherent human need to learn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2g2xpdbpm64tdkgm21xsw))
- When you prioritize learning, you become a great leader who can spot and develop talent in people who might themselves be unaware of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2g5tbqtt1wy2q85hf5cd4))
- Not giving regular feedback about performance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2gb6m47bwgrc4r9p4t0rv))
- People achieve high performance only if they know the truth about their effectiveness. Leaders often ignore this need and thereby rob people of the key to develop their skills and talents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2geq8tcc6jcm21pe732cg))
- Not taking emotions into account ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2gtxvtbcmhf7sp27hbxvm))
- You can make a huge difference simply by being aware of these emotions and showing authentic empathy in that part of a person’s experience.  Learn to use respectfully the question, ‘How do you feel?” and not just, “What do you think?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2ha1pty61yz05t22qv26q))
- Managing conflict ineffectively ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2he0676yr0b0n19xv9eqy))
- Conflicts that are not addressed can block co-operation and alignment around common goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2hg5y4r8082wgdfxfwyvt))
- Not driving change ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2hjxwaca72tsctjq5skpp))
- Explain the benefits that changes will bring – and do so knowing that people do not naturally resist change: they resist the fear of the unknown or the pain that might come with the transition. Your job is to be a “secure base” who gives a sense of psychological safety as well as the encouragement and energy to explore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2hrvw6vya7h4k7jm2qd78))
- Not encouraging others to take risks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2j3vm45k69pytxf9ncnct))
- Too many leaders encourage people to stay in their comfort zone, or, as I like to say, “play not to lose”.  However, the best leaders create enough trust so that others feel safe and supported to take risks and “play to win”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2jb8q0fa0vzr2gmwfmb3g))
- Misunderstanding motivation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2jspfhep7b2p5apmzzbzd))
- Most people are driven by “intrinsic motivators” like being challenged, learning something new, making an important difference, having a meaning or purpose, or developing their talents. Too many leaders miss the opportunity to capitalize on this internal guidance system and instead focus on “extrinsic motivators” like bonuses, promotions, money, and artificial rewards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2jn67jah02hvzysetbbyz))
- Managing activities rather than leading people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2jwjhakk293zmmax8612d))
- so much of management is about controlling, administering, and planning activities, and, by extension, people. Leadership, on the other hand, involves inspiring, encouraging, and bringing out the very best in people by building a sense of trust and by challenging them to take positive risks.
