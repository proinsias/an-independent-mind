## Highlights
- Instead of focusing on the projected adoption of AI in every facet of our lives, consider honing in on what is unAI-able.

So I’ve identified three categories of human-driven decision-making competencies that every sector and industry currently needs and will require for the foreseeable future.

- **Critical Thinking.** Our human ability to assess and evaluate circumstances is one of our distinguishing traits. Critical thinking skills combines problem-solving, curiosity, creativity, inference and strategy. AI can’t do one of these critical thinking elements well.

- AI reaches this cement ceiling because reasonings and judgements are made through balancing lived experience, expertise and skills. AI has no lived experience, limited expertise as dictated by training/testing datasets and programmable skills. The rest is covered by people as they exercise their critical thinking skills.
