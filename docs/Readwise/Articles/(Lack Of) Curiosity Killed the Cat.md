## Highlights
- Good PMs start from the user and problem — they are curious to understand why users have a problem, what their alternatives are, and what a good solution should look like.
- Good PMs start from the user and problem — they are curious to understand why users have a problem, what their alternatives are, and what a good solution should look like. They use that knowledge to frame a solution that resonates with users. They are also curious about the tools, technologies and skills available to their engineering team to pull together the best solution for the problem. A lot of product management is in fact experimentation — you start with a thesis, and continuously validate it with as little effort as possible. Having curiosity is key to selecting the right experiments and iterating quickly.
- the best salespeople end up being decent product managers — they not only help customers understand their product and be successful, they help the product team understand customer pain points at a reasonably detailed level. They are always curious to understand how things work end to end and over time develop a good sense for how things should work — both from their customer’s perspective and their own solution or product.
- Curiosity is life blood for engineers. No amount of training or practice can make you a better engineer. The only way to become good at what you do is to be curious enough to understand how things work. By browsing code, by debugging, by testing, by tinkering, by just breaking things and fixing them. Without the curiosity to understand how things work, you cannot grow as an engineer. The best engineers don’t limit themselves to coding, they make an effort to understand the product, the market, and the end to end customer flow. They’re curious to know how customers discover the product, why they use it, where they spend time on, and why they stay. They look at the big picture.
- People with a fixed mindset think they know what they’re good at and what they’re not, and are afraid to get out of their comfort zone. People with a growth mindset look at everything they know and have as an asset, and look for ways to build upon their knowledge with experimentation and new learning. What sets them apart is a belief that they can develop any skill with effort, and every failure is merely a data point to learn and grow from.
- Here’s how I identify intelligent people: Not by their IQ on a test. Not by their ability to solve complex abstract problems. I believe that intelligence is the ability to understand new concepts and situations quickly and go into some degree of depth. Being able to do so comes from curiosity. You can identify intelligent people simply by discussing a concept or situation they’ve never been exposed to and see what kind of questions they ask. I find intelligent people engage and quickly ask the right questions. They’re curious to get to the gist of things. A ten minute conversation with them will leave you deep in thought — often with questions you may not have thought before. You walk away enlightened and energized — not because you got answers, but because you got some good questions to think about.
- So no matter what your role is, be curious. Think about how and why things work the way they work, and try to get to the bottom of things — build out the jigsaw puzzle in your head and get facile enough to know how things relate to each other. Toyota’s 5 Why’s framework is a good way to structure it — it’s a simple framework that helps you get to the bottom of problems. Start by asking why, and answer it with a grounded fact. Then, ask why recursively until you’ve asked 5 why’s. That will help you separate symptoms and problems. Don’t attempt to solve problems until you’ve fully understood what exactly the problems are. In many cases, you’re likely solving symptoms and not problems.
