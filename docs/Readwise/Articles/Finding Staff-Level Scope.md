## Highlights
- My biggest gap going from Senior to Staff Software Engineer was in finding staff-level scope. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b5wn7zkhecfhx3wvt7c9x5))
- To become a Staff Engineer you need to find work that fits these criteria and then deliver it. **Otherwise** **you can’t grow to that level no matter how hard you work**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b5x0ah3gp1wnnzbcax173f))
- To find potential work you can ask your manager or skip manager about their top-of-mind problems and opportunities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b5xvsxj8gswr3673b93pcr))
- What if there is impactful work that your management chain isn’t aware of yet? You have the opportunity to convince people that the work is important and then see it through.
  This approach is riskier since there’s an extra step in convincing others.

It also helps you build the skill of influencing others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b5y4gn96by4fs5dstpaxdx))
