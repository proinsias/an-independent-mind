## Highlights
- The reality is that addressing data quality is unlikely to be the initiative that teams *want* to prioritize ahead of building shiny new products or services, but it’s often the one that they *need* to prioritize in order to maintain trust or scale their team and platform. And without accountability, the lower visibility tasks that advance data quality, such as unit tests or documentation, simply won’t get done to the degree they should.

- Having the data engineering team lead the response to data quality is by far the most common pattern. It is deployed by about half of all organizations that use a modern data stack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29j76tvrfpp8btnhyvhvkyz))
- There are downsides to this approach however. For one, data engineers are often in short supply and so focused on systems and pipelines that they don’t always have as deep domain knowledge of the data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29j7f3qfxv6m0refcrdcrc3))
- And while it is efficient to have the pipeline builder and maintainer be the same person, this can also create silos of tribal knowledge that can be lost when people leave and others attempt to onboard ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29j7sxenjvp9e7xsvk5c25w))
- Effective approaches to mitigate these challenges can be to emphasize the importance of documentation to ensure knowledge transfer and to embed teams, or pair engineers with embedded analysts, to better source domain knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29j8675wkmt7ka59w4sjyce))
- Analytics engineering teams often boast a blend of technical expertise with deep domain knowledge, making them effective leaders on data quality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29j8zsm9s0y6hnxzsbved4y))
- The strength of this approach is the strong domain expertise of a typical analytics engineer. They are well-positioned to navigate both pipeline reliability and field-level quality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29j998eyn2k5k42038vrfa0))
- The downside may be limitations in their capacity to solve infrastructure problems or coordinate with upstream data-producing teams and systems. Only a fraction of data quality problems originate in the transformation layer, so the analytics engineers will require strong partnerships with product and platform engineering teams, to effectively triage issues in the source systems and ingestion layer respectively. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29j9g18hcq9bt7tp5h3zpzd))
- Data governance teams often take the lead on data quality alongside the larger mandate of data security, privacy and access. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29jad5b0wzcs45hrzcv065s))
- The strength is in establishing a comprehensive strategy that considers the entire value chain of data, influencing the behavior of data producers, engineers and data consumers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29jahhebvxy3yfe1pc06ghg))
- Data governance teams enact change through technical standards, policies and business processes for other teams to adopt. But adoption is always more challenging when not backed by the compliance mandate of security or privacy initiatives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29jatt7gzv661e5mfpbtqa5))
- At scale, it’s critical for governance teams to create the global standards for quality data, such as the minimum requirements for documentation, monitoring and SLAs, then federate accountability across the various data owners, whether they be organized into domains or data teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29jbzsgmhe8yfsgtxmt7e0x))
- Data reliability engineering is a specialized subset of data engineering that is focused exclusively on responsive and preventive practices to increase the quality and reliability of data systems. It is not as common of a structure, but rapidly picking up steam ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29jcgs71y3zhx54nz1hwpd8))
- However, teams and data environments need to be sufficiently large enough to gain the appropriate efficiencies from specialization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29jct8a67d2qv3z05j5rm31))
- Finally, some organizations, particularly larger ones, will leverage data analysts or specialized data quality analysts.
  The strength of this structure is these analysts are usually very close to the business and well positioned to define the required quality standards, and develop tailored tests or monitors to enforce those standards. 
  However, these teams often require a strong connection to data engineering in order to effectively be able to triage and troubleshoot issues upstream ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29jd4kttsqzabd4r2hvxbex))
