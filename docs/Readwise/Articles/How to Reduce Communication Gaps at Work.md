## Highlights
- Spend time at the beginning of the project clarifying dependencies and seeking alignment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d7pzg9btb256q9yj9fhbmn))
- Be explicit about your needs. Need training, access to a particular resource, context surrounding a problem, clarity on requirements, or even help from others? Stop assuming others know what you want, and explicitly ask for it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d7q7dx4th7kwrcn7jkc2az))
- If something is important, it deserves attention. The only way to make sure it’s heard is to repeat it. Keep doing it till it’s obvious to everyone. Repetition may irritate a few people, but it’s better to irritate than leave it open for confusion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d7qgpzrmxhxb2zcxeqhhjh))
- Stop pretending to listen and actually pay attention and be present. Keep distractions (email, chat, phone) away and commit to being part of the conversation—mentally as well as physically. You’ll end up with better solutions and much better outcomes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d7qphjpvk67sft3tbbxfmr))
- Listen with curiosity. Speak with honesty. Act with integrity. The greatest problem with communication is we don’t listen to understand. We listen to reply. When we listen with curiosity, we don’t listen with the intent to reply. We listen for what’s behind the words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d7r74dt9ff4sa9n76avk1e))
- Peace is built on understanding, and wars are built on misunderstandings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d7rt9mzjnqrjrghjadpw1m))
- Sharing weekly updates with my manager and other stakeholders. Highlight the key milestones, projects on track, projects in a risk zone, and the next steps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d7sjakvmr27c773q78yc97))
- Holding others accountable to stick to their side of the deal and making sure they understand the impact of not meeting these expectations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d84xvws1s3g2hhtrk07106))
- Aligning on the success criteria—how it will be measured ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d856jyqg2tytg175e4xf6x))
- if I have to deliver API endpoints with certain functionality, agree upfront on what makes these endpoints successful (format, error codes, QPS, response time, etc.). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d8590t18xrf7ddj4enrw62))
- don’t assume things will get better on their own. Don’t crib. Don’t complain. Don’t accept the status quo, and learn to live with communication issues. Adopt the start, stop, and continue framework and be part of the change. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d85j7gz4n5bpg56q818p27))
- You can get discouraged many times, but you are not a failure until you begin to blame somebody else and stop trying.
