## Highlights
- Your code documentation should involve two pieces:
  1. Comments within the code using proper Python comment conventions.
  2. Supporting documentation that elaborates on the comments.
  Each new code commit should include at a minimum these [three types of comments](https://towardsdatascience.com/software-engineering-best-practices-for-data-scientists-4c199ede6e03):
  1. A comment at the top of the newly committed code that gives a brief description of the goal of the code and its functionality.
  2. A comment at the top of each function describing its inputs, outputs, and what logic it's performing.
  3. A comment at the top of any logic or practical one-liners that aren’t necessarily easily understood so that your thoughts as the author can be organized and better understood by those looking at your code from the outside.
  Supporting code documentation should be written anytime you write a substantial piece of code that will have major implications once added to the production code. This [external document should include](https://towardsdatascience.com/software-engineering-best-practices-for-data-scientists-4c199ede6e03):
  • The goal and functionality of the code.
  • Instructions on how to integrate your code (if necessary).
  • An explanation of tricky or hard-to-understand parts of your code in long form where you take the time to describe exactly what the code does line-by-line, perhaps with a brief description of why you chose to write the code the way you did.
  • Screenshots to help with debugging and troubleshooting.
  • Helpful links to external supporting documentation.
  • Your contact information if additional information or help is required. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2x2d96eb228mrnh8r6nq615))
