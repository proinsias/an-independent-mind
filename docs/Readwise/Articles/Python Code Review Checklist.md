## Highlights
- Good PRs are composed of bite-sized changes and solve a single well-defined problem. They should be focused and purposefully narrow to have as few merge conflicts as possible. Put simply, a good PR facilitates being reviewed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h33fwve68kthjhxc1j88e6x3))
- For large-scale swooping changes, make a separate target branch and then make small incremental PRs to that target, finally merging the target with the main branch. Making one humongous PR makes it harder to review, and if it goes stale, many merge conflicts may pop up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h33fx3dybmk1qmqyascp3xhz))
- A good code review not only improves the code but the coder as well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h33g29fnn6vqp1z7nbb30js7))
