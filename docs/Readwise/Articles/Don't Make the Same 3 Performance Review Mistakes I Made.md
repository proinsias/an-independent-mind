## Highlights
- I should have listed out the goals of the business **first** and under each, list what I did to further those goals, ideally using metrics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h33frave3pv3waf8shpdgcxa))
- **Goal:** Improve click-throughs by 10% on the pricing page
  • **Action:** Improved click-throughs by 15% by A/B testing multiple variations of the pricing page.
  • **How:** Proposed an initiative to try different variations of the pricing page, got cross-functional buy-in by working with team leads, set up weekly syncs to ensure consistent progress, and gave a presentation to the company afterward about our impact and how they can achieve similar results.

- The process that has generally worked for me is the following:
  1. Schedule a meeting every 6-8 weeks that’s separate from your regular 1:1 meetings. Reserve 1 hour for it instead of 30 minutes just in case extra time is needed.
  2. The meeting should be dedicated specifically to feedback over the past 6-8 weeks and ways your manager sees room for improvement.
  3. If possible, you can discuss your company’s career framework attributes at the current or next level and discuss feedback in the context of those. Identify strength and growth areas by asking your manager to highlight the framework attributes in “green” (consistently good), “yellow” (show more signs to reach green), or “red” (needs dedicated focus). Once you have been consistently green on the attributes for the current and next level, both you and your manager should agree you are ready for promotion.

- To make your performance review as easy as possible to write, set up a calendar invite for yourself every 2 weeks (I do end of day Friday) where you note down what you did the last 2 weeks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h33ftwx56atqek6k4jxg1kh9))
    - Note: I should add this to my weekly review
