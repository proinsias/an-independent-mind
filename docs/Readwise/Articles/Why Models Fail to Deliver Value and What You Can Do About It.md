## Highlights
- VentureBeat AI concluded that just 13% of data science projects make it into production) and in terms of delivering value to the business, Gartner predicts that only 20% of analytics projects will deliver business outcomes that improve performance.

- many data science projects fail to deliver value because, at the highest level, Data Science and the business simply aren’t connected. This devolves into a variety of challenges:
  Data science projects start without business support or a key stakeholder to act as the domain expert during model development. 
  Organizations struggle to translate business challenges into solvable data science problems. Often, data science teams emphasize finding novel insights rather than pinpointing how a business process can be improved. This means many projects get stuck in endless research and experimentation. 
  The question being asked cannot be sufficiently answered with the available data or the costs associated with data extraction from systems are too high due to a lack of connectivity across applications. 
  There is a lack of clarity between Data Science and IT teams on how to deploy models into production. Without a feasible, repeatable method for deploying model code, models can languish on the shelf while business opportunity passes.

- data scientists should start each new project by answering three critical questions:
  Do we have a business problem with a clear path to value? 
  Is the problem feasible for us to solve? 
  Can the business make the necessary changes resulting from data science insights?
  It's important to note that answering these questions often requires an exploration phase during which data scientists work with business stakeholders to assess the problem, profile the data available, and build a rough idea of their approach to solve the problem.
  While this initial phase is crucial, we find many projects get stuck here. A good rule of thumb is:
  If you’re unable to answer these questions with business stakeholders within two to four weeks -- or at least be able to identify what is required to be able to answer them -- the odds of a successful outcome diminish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2qr958yvtftcesbtvyw9e))
- Data Science creates value by providing an evidence-based approach to decision making. Decisions made based on model results should ultimately reduce cost or increase revenue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2pv2yhrxcnq18ng34xjm4))
- Problem statements should ultimately:
  • Include a problem definition.
  • Identify a driver of cost or revenue within the business.
  • Identify a source of variability in that driver.
  • Identify metrics that measure this variability.
  • Identify a clear path to creating quantifiable value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2rbcx45ymj25d3c2rhkxg))
- There are many different factors to assess whether the problem identified in the problem statement can actually be solved.
  Some of those factors include:
  • Do we have enough data available, and is it accurate enough?
  • If the data isn’t high enough in quality or you can’t get consistent access to it, chances are the project is dead on arrival. Even if you do have the data, if you don’t understand what the data means or a subject matter expert isn’t available to assist you, any insight being generated won’t be understood well enough to turn into a repeatable solution to the problem.
  • Do we have the technical capabilities to produce the model?
  • Do we have business support that can be involved in our approach to solving the problem?
  • If the business isn't willing to provide resources to the data science team as they work on the problem, the likelihood that your model will be adopted and implemented diminishes. Gaining business support through the development of the model significantly increases the chances of uptake once you deploy it.
  • Are there any potential issues that may be critical failure points in deploying a model?
  • For example, running afoul of regulatory standards or company values are of course deal-breakers, as can be less obvious issues such as using customer data in ways that are permissible but may lead to negative public perception and reputation damage.

- In many failed projects, communication between subject matter experts and data scientists stops once the problem statement is approved.
  Fostering two-way transparent communication between data scientists and the decision-maker responsible for the value driver is crucial. Sharing insights early and often helps the business understand the actions they need to take to leverage the model output.
  Assessing whether a business unit is able to make a change often comes down to working with business analysts and solution architects to understand their business processes and any technology implications that changing them would generate.
