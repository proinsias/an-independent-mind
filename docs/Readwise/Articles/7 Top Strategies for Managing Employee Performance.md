- establishing a baseline of where your employee is today. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2ase88wp75q7vydn8hhpr))
- Deliver ongoing feedback. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2awvvpbkd3yfbe88za0j7))
- Delivering [ongoing feedback](https://lattice.com/library/how-to-create-a-feedback-culture) keeps your employees in the loop about what they need to work on in real time, which can help avoid any potential misunderstandings or surprises come review time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2bevwyst51mnkp3dqx96x))
- Follow-up on (and measure) action items. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2bjdgvvmr55nw389q8ypc))
- if a manager simply tells an employee to improve — but that is never followed-up on — then it won’t occur. If you tell an employee you will be measuring that improvement — and hold them accountable for addressing any skill gaps — then [they are] much more likely to engage in the resulting development actions put in place.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2bv0yxm3hgyx76w358z4p))
- Avoid “performance *micro*management.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2bxnm9w39y5gg83h6p64j))
- Employees “don’t want you to ‘manage’ their performance; they want to be inspired, supported, and developed to make a bigger impact,” Goldberg stressed. “This is not an invitation to micromanage.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2c35e4ecxxd6s2r8qyd75))
- While it’s important to give your team the support and oversight they need to hit their performance goals, it’s also necessary to give them the space and autonomy to hit those goals in their own way. Make sure you’re not being overly involved — to the point of micromanaging — as they do that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2c9xsnzbff5e9b2dd1qxj))
- Help your team see the bigger picture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2ck9q6b7qvyq5eqrybqjc))
- areas you think they can improve and help them develop a plan to make those improvements — think of that as the *how*. But if you want your employees to follow through, you need to give them a reason to improve — a strong *why* that’s going to inspire them to make the changes necessary to perform at a higher level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2cq5y9m885m6h94vmhqex))
- Help people understand the [purpose and meaning in their work](https://lattice.com/library/the-three-pillars-of-company-culture),” advised Thackeray. “Linking day-to-day tasks to a [vision or goal](https://lattice.com/library/how-to-keep-company-core-values-relevant-and-tangible) that is bigger than themselves helps to create aspirational thinking and a sense of belonging [and drive improvement].” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2czr9bsx74avfbe8x4028))
- Build on wins. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2d2w60am7s2yc9cwrf0xw))
- work with them to [highlight their achievement](https://lattice.com/library/5-creative-ways-to-celebrate-goals-even-when-youre-remote) — and on how to spread that success across all areas of their role,” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2db1sajyztwgdbjwwjt1x))
