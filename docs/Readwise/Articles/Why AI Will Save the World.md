## Highlights
- The core mistake the automation-kills-jobs doomers keep making is called the [Lump Of Labor Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy). This fallacy is the incorrect notion that there is a fixed amount of labor to be done in the economy at any given time, and either machines do it or people do it – and if machines do it, there will be no work for people to do.

- The Lump Of Labor Fallacy flows naturally from naive intuition, but naive intuition here is wrong. When technology is applied to production, we get [*productivity growth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity) – an increase in output generated by a reduction in inputs. The result is *lower prices* for goods and services. As prices for goods and services fall, we pay less for them, meaning that we now have *extra spending power* with which to buy *other things*. This *increases demand* in the economy, which drives the creation of *new production* – including new products and new industries – which then creates new jobs for the people who were replaced by machines in prior jobs. The result is a larger economy with higher material prosperity, more industries, more products, and more jobs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2by8xj98mgaxpcejqz8j0b2))
- But the good news doesn’t stop there. We also get higher wages. This is because, at the level of the individual worker, the marketplace sets compensation as a function of the [*marginal productivity of the worker*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_revenue_productivity_theory_of_wages). A worker in a technology-infused business will be more productive than a worker in a traditional business. The employer will either pay that worker more money as he is now more productive, or another employer will, purely out of self interest. The result is that technology introduced into an industry generally not only increases the number of jobs in the industry but also raises wages.
