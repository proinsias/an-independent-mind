## Highlights
- The whole point of these models is you give them a sequence of words — or you give them a sequence of tokens, which are almost words — and you say, ‘here’s a sequence of words, predict the next ones.’
  “But there is no mechanism to say ‘some of these words are more important than others,’ or ‘some of these words are exact instructions about what you should do and the other ones are input words that you should affect with the other words, but you shouldn’t obey further instructions.’ There is no difference between the two. It’s just a sequence of tokens. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29bykt59npjxkep14128gyn))
