## Highlights
- The **Driver** is the person at the wheel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thr1qafm521yc7cn197jhg))
- The **Navigator** is in the observer position ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thr56ehcz3pc1smmmg82bg))
- The idea of this role division is to have two different perspectives on the code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thqvt8jsp8ctzb4kgcgn9s))
- The driver's thinking is supposed to be more tactical, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thre41v1sebvezrnbf7x3q))
- The navigator can think more strategically in their observing role ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thrqme51pgqx1f6wg2kzmx))
- Write a failing test (red), make it pass with the minimum necessary means (green), and then [refactor](https://martinfowler.com/tags/refactoring.html). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thta0ywn2fbdz1yx1gewcf))
- Strong-Style Pairing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thvttsnjdjcanxns1bjn1g))
- This is a technique particularly useful for knowledge transfer, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thvyqh2tb2n37w2t8eq29w))
- it can be a useful onboarding tool to favor active "learning by doing" over passive "learning by watching" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thvf72hfc6386c75s6dkjc))
- Another thing to work on together beyond the code is documentation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1thyre7z67zrj0yc8p2kk1t))
    - Note: Ideal for our team! Set up weekly sessions!

- Rotating pairs means that after working together for some time, one half of the pair leaves the story, while the other person onboards somebody new to continue. The person who stays is often called the "anchor" of a story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1tj0zcwb6b9mgdme2gyfcvn))
- the most given reason for pair rotations is to avoid knowledge silos, increase collective code ownership, and get some more code review on-the-go ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1tj1hsc4d7b8wp3p4ay4t6d))
- The term "show and tell" is used in different ways on agile teams. What we are referring to here is a regularly scheduled developer huddle, a time of the week where developers get together and discuss tech debt, learnings, share a significant piece of new code with each other, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1tj2amx8hsc1rw31116420q))
    - Note: What I should present at DS meetings.
- Apply the "5 seconds rule": When the navigator sees the driver do something "wrong" and wants to comment, wait at least 5 seconds before you say something - the driver might already have it in mind, then you are needlessly interrupting their flow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1vdq1yfxjsnnrm0g4scyysp))
- Always use the new joiners' machine when pairing, to make sure that they are set up to work by themselves as well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1vdxhh36wapq116vhhqw5nj))
- At the end of a day of pairing, do a round of feedback for each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1vdznqbvg6axgz4apqr6yez))
