## Highlights
- The researchers identified 10 categories of technical debt, listed in order of the most to least frequently reported as a hindrance to productivity: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bq9egzmdvpq9kbgsvfx5g))
- **Migration is needed or in progress:** This may be motivated by the need to scale, due to mandates, to reduce dependencies, or to avoid deprecated technology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqajesa9yxgckb10pcce9))
- **Documentation on project and application programming interfaces (APIs):** Information on how your project works is hard to find, missing or incomplete, or may include documentation on APIs or inherited code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqb0ac02rbm7s26dn2zf5))
- **Testing:** Poor test quality or coverage, such as missing tests or poor test data, results in fragility, flaky tests, or lots of rollbacks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqbazd1w1cv3pnertpyep))
- **Code quality:** Product architecture or code within a project was not well designed. It may have been rushed or a prototype/demo. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqbqswmewgw7s7y11myrn))
- **Dead and/or abandoned code:** Code/features/projects were replaced or superseded but not removed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqc9jwd1j0tjw47znd4gb))
- **Code degradation:** The code base has degraded or not kept up with changing standards over time. The code may be in maintenance mode, in need of refactoring or updates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqcnkf1ke5hftr3bn0ax2))
- **Team lacks necessary expertise:** This may be due to staffing gaps and turnover or inherited orphaned code/projects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqd0vfwrsp2f9a2xmfb0h))
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies are unstable, rapidly changing, or trigger rollbacks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqdh15y3xhr5xj059z1md))
- **Migration was poorly executed or abandoned:** This may have resulted in maintaining two versions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqdw5yh3988fgwz98zvat))
- **Release process:** The rollout and monitoring of production needs to be updated, migrated, or maintained. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32bqe8m93wrc58dgxrs1mpw))
