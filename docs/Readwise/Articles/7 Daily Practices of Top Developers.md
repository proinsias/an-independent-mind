## Highlights
- The greatest engineers I know are great at getting to the bottom of a feature.Why are we building this?Why now?Who needs it?How will they use it?Is this the simplest version we can build?
- Great engineers take product ownership seriously. They want to know the full picture, up front.
- The best engineers love tight feedback loops. Always strive to get your code running and under test as fast as possible.
- Top developers are ruthless about priority.
- Modularity means breaking a big problem into smaller pieces. Often, those smaller pieces can be reused.Great developers do this while they’re coding. They create functions and classes that have a single responsibility. Shared data models and code reuse are the hallmarks of a great coder.
- I think every developer should keep a coding journal, take great notes, and publish a blog.
- As a top developer, your time is precious. Protect it.
- Observability & monitoring are key parts of maintaining software at scale. Often overlooked by less-experienced developers, veterans know how important it is to have insight into what’s happening.When things go wrong, you’ll need logs, metrics, and reporting on what exactly isn’t working.Top developers build with monitoring and observability in mind up front.
