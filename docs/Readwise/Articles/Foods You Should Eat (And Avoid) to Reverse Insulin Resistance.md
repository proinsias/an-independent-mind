## Highlights
- If you’re eating with the aim to improve your insulin sensitivity, a general rule of thumb is to add lots of [colorful vegetables to your plate](https://www.veri.co/learn/eat-the-rainbow-fruits-veggies), make sure you’re getting enough [fiber](https://www.veri.co/learn/fiber-and-blood-sugar), and eat lean proteins and healthy fats with most of your meals. Look for these 4 ingredients in particular: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c8158v2x70pahfydbng1az))
- A [small study of 30 adults](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027153172200077X) found that eating lentils 5 times per week for 8 weeks reversed insulin resistance, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c82a92wz0s2drmcd7cwcb1))
- What makes this such a star ingredient is its minimal flavor and endless versatility: add it to smoothies, desserts, dips, and dressing (to name several) for body and texture, or enjoy it as a side or topping to a ton of meals.

- Processed foods, high-fructose corn syrup, and [refined sugar](https://www.veri.co/learn/fructose-vs-glucose-vs-sucrose) are commonly understood to have negative effects on your health if overconsumed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c83fph8xsm7w1q0bwc3hjc))
- Consider protein-rich, high-fiber, and low-GI breakfast options such as an omelet with vegetables, steel-cut oats with nut butter, and berries with Greek yogurt (but not yogurt that has pre-added fruit, which tends to be high in sugar). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c843kkef4mhhnp6pn10z40))
- eating fried foods has been [linked to a less diverse gut microbiome](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/9/1907/138884/Fried-Foods-Gut-Microbiota-and-Glucose-Metabolism), which can make your gut more permeable and increase your risk of [insulin resistance and inflammation](https://www.veri.co/learn/what-causes-insulin-resistance-not-diet) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c84mph7cwjs1dk89yttz16))
- Boiled and roasted potatoes, for instance, [have the least impact on your glucose levels](https://www.nutritionletter.tufts.edu/ask-experts/what-potatoes-have-the-highest-glycemic-index/) [14]. Leaving the peel on potatoes also increases their fiber content. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c84yz1kmgce6c8cb9wejec))
- the best hack for potatoes is to cook them, let them cool, and then reheat them — a process which increases their resistant starch content and can actually [improve insulin sensitivity](https://www.veri.co/learn/blood-sugar-balancing-foods-tips). Try boiling whole potatoes ahead of time, keeping them in the fridge throughout the week, and then dicing and roasting them in olive oil and herbs as needed.

- sucralose (Splenda) and saccharin (Sweet 'N Low) have been shown to change the [composition of bacteria in the gut](https://www.veri.co/learn/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you) and even impair glycemic response in healthy adults, and some artificial sweeteners trigger an outsized insulin response — i.e., even though they aren’t raising your glucose levels, your body still overproduces insulin, which can promote fat storage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c8672ccydaf8wk8asnj07q))
- go for seltzer with a squeeze of lemon, unsweetened tea (with an optional splash of almond milk), or water infused with citrus slices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2c86fncqvs4c4f1mjrtjj6b))
