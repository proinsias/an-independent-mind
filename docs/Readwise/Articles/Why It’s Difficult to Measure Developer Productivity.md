## Highlights
- Software engineering is a creative endeavor. It is not about the production of uniform, interchangeable outputs. Therefore:
  • *Throughput* cannot be conflated with *productivity.*
  • We cannot assume the product that was built is the right product*.* It may have performance issues or it may not scale; there are quality, reliability, and practicality aspects of creating software.
  • We cannot assume that when work doesn’t result in output, it has no value. Problem solving is a core part of software engineering and it is hard to measure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32jnwdwd6z1drzxgpgkzr9f))
- Attempts to quantify work productivity by borrowing methods from operating machinery are not suited to software engineering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32jp2xqwdstp5sbdwxykajf))
