## Highlights
- It brings the business so much long-term value that every hour invested into documentation by anyone saves literally x100 productivity hours across the company. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6cymsfs2gdtpxd12pg0f2))
- Every single thing that is not written down equals wasted resources in the future and a potential for headaches. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6dpx06bm2fjc7y6p1st9y))
- **If you’re a technical co-founder - extract every bit of knowledge that you can and put it into writing.** This will serve as a universal source of truth, a dynamic repository that captures and preserves collective wisdom. This wisdom can help everyone on the team solve issues they had no idea how to solve a minute ago. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6eepf50gfpfpm45q5j4je))
- The constant need to have meetings is a symptom of a deeper problem — **a lack of clear, accessible, and reliable documentation.** A well-documented workflow doesn't need an hour-long session for clarification. A well-documented decision doesn't need a room full of people to understand its rationale. A well-documented knowledge base doesn't need a group huddle whenever a new member joins the team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6f6yxj4hr8a75xdvegzf8))
- Think about it: every unnecessary meeting is a missed opportunity. It's time that could have been spent refining that crucial algorithm or simply taking a moment to recharge and prevent burnout. In essence, reducing the reliance on meetings isn't just about reclaiming time; it's about reclaiming the ability to focus, innovate, and create — the very lifeblood of a startup. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6g7fnx4tr0wan77crcgyx))
- Most meetings could easily be replaced by a well-drafted document that presents the relevant data and proposed solutions and invites feedback. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6gd79cwdhmk0543jt8b2a))
- meetings often favor the loudest voices, not necessarily those with the best ideas. It's a subtle form of bias that can stifle innovation and diversity of thought. Documentation, on the other hand, levels the playing field. It provides a platform for every team member to articulate their thoughts and insights, regardless of rank or communication style. It promotes a culture of thoughtfulness and reflection rather than snap judgments and impulsive decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6gqf6m3nk8p94wfd7tetn))
- Every decision is a brick in the foundation of your growing startup, and documenting them can provide a solid record, a kind of architecture blueprint that details your thought processes, concerns, and rationale. This clarity can be invaluable as you scale and face increasingly complex challenges. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6hdm5a689zhzpvz44jsxz))
- When you introduce documentation into your decision-making process, it acts as a knowledge repository. It holds the context, the insights, and the learning that came with each decision. And this repository can be referred back to when similar situations arise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6hrbqyk1hg1wsjtszpsr8))
- Encourage your team to document their decision-making process to clarify assumptions, reasoning, and expected outcomes. Make it a standard practice to discuss these documented decisions in your meetings, promoting a culture of open feedback and collaborative decision-making. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6j3txkhswxzhpaz63s0z0))
- Documentation-first culture means cultivating a shared consciousness in your startup, a unifying force that links everyone together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6j9aqrft813zzy78xfh3f))
- Your role in this can be as a catalyst and a facilitator. Always start by setting an example. Document your own processes and decisions and share them openly. Take notes, always. Encourage a culture of feedback and learning, where every document is a starting point for discussion, improvement, and innovation. If a decision needs to be made, start with a document, not a meeting. If there’s a pros/cons discussion — start with a document. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6k22mxx47h8r9da7prb2x))
- By encouraging your colleagues to document their processes, decisions, and learnings, you're showing that you value their insights and experiences. This fosters a sense of ownership and engagement beyond their designated roles and tasks. They become active contributors to the company's knowledge base and its success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6km2h9rb3jve05ws9f16y))
- Prepare templates AND guidelines. Think of them as the DNA of your documentation - they provide the structure, consistency, and predictability that allow your knowledge to replicate and spread effectively throughout the organization. This is a complex and time-intensive task, but once you have them, it gets easier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6m1s90qrwm6njgvqh7gqy))
- Templates ensure the information is recorded in a standardized format, making it easy to understand and compare. On the other hand, guidelines provide the 'rules of the game,’ ensuring that everyone understands what to document, how to do it, and where to find it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6m73qfd1scsg8dd255rfb))
- Create checklists, initiate review processes, and set up version control. These tools aren't chains; they help your documentation speak with one voice, one tone, and one style ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6mg63222kde1xhzrj0t9v))
- Promote documentation as a part of your company's values. Encourage your team to see it not as an additional chore but as an integral part of their work, as vital as writing code. Make it a routine part of performance evaluations and feedback sessions. Ask them to improve it, and ask them to find flaws in your processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6mse4nag0c63y0pwykp4z))
- Designating a dedicated team or individual for documentation in an early-stage startup can seem extravagant. But trust me, it’s one of the smartest investments you can make. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6n6br0ykytyjcpr5fxww5))
- The benefits extend beyond mere knowledge management. Your documentation team can enhance overall organizational effectiveness by bridging gaps between teams, facilitating cross-functional collaboration, and breaking down silos. They serve as the glue that binds all your team brains together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6pd8ppz04wgc6sy23ezdq))
- **our document isn't a monument.** It's not something you build once and forget about. It's a growing, evolving entity that needs regular updates and maintenance. Your organization changes, your knowledge expands, and your document needs to reflect that.
  • Track the last changed dates, and update those older than a year.
  • Track who the owner of this information is, and update it regularly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6qgtt2c26pkxr1fwcw2ry))
- Start by documenting your code, your decisions, and your learnings. Make it a part of your daily workflow, not an end-of-the-day chore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6sa0ajm3q3s5zjm0nw47h))
- If there’s one thing you can take out from this article, carry this mantra with you: *"Document to empower, document to grow."* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3b6sh3je2xg7sxny7se7vpk))
