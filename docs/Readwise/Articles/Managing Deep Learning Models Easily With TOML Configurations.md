## Highlights
- TOML, stands for [*Tomâ€™s Obvious Minimal Language*](https://toml.io/en/), is file-format designed specifically for configuration files. The concept of a TOML file is quite similar to [YAML/YML files](https://yaml.org/) which have the ability to store key-value pairs in a tree-like hierarchy. [An advantage of TOML over YAML is its readability](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/6f82nu/yaml_vs_toml/) which becomes important when there are multiple nested levels.

- read the configuration from a TOML files, two Python packages can be used, `[toml](https://github.com/uiri/toml)` and `[munch](https://github.com/uiri/toml)` . `toml` will help us read the TOML file and return the contents of the file as a Python `dict` . `munch` will convert the contents of the `dict` to enable attribute-style access of elements. For instance, instead of writing, `config[ "training" ][ "num_epochs" ]` , we can just write `config.training.num_epochs` which enhances readability.
