## Highlights
- One of the biggest insights from these AI successes is that they don’t see AI projects as application development or functionality-driven projects. Rather, they see them as data projects, or sometimes even data products. A data project doesn’t start with an idea of what the functionality needs to be, but rather focuses on what insights or actions need to be gleaned from the data in whatever current shape it’s in.

- the functionality is determined by the training data and the configuration of the system. Therefore, to achieve the desired outcome of an AI project requires focus on data iteration and data-centric methods versus coding-centric methods.

- However, Agile falls flat when dealing with AI because it doesn’t tell you how to deal with data, the core asset of an AI system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h33ezh3vcmztakm98c10g4ca))
- Another approach is the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), a decades old method that guides data mining efforts. However, it’s particularly focused on data projects and lacks some critical elements needed for AI projects, and hasn’t been updated in over two decades.

- The problem with waterfall is, especially for large and continuously changing projects, this process can take a very long time - sometimes upwards of 18-24 months. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h33f3end5h0nwttcy6vs1x6t))
- Approaches such as the [Cognitive Project Management for AI (CPMAI) methodology](https://www.cognilytica.com/cpmai/?utm_source=forbes) are blending data-centric approaches with agile methods to produce methods that are more optimized for the highly data-centric, variable nature of AI projects.
