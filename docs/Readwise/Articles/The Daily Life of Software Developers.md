## Highlights
- On “good” days, developers spend more time developing and less time collaborating ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32z3admt0rbza7w0k5q4x30))
- developers feel more positive on work days where they can work alone and focus most of their time on development related activities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32z3nptqq2n3q9g5jn15ec1))
- Developers prefer coding versus meetings, but their attitude toward meetings depends on the development phase. “We should actively work on reducing interruptions and meetings during the development phase (and on development-heavy days), and encourage them at times when collaboration is most crucial, such as phases of planning/specification, testing and release.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32z43bj93fhvzf90p25g7e4))
