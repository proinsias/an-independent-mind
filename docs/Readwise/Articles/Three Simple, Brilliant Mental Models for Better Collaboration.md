## Highlights
- The Abilene Paradox is a common phenomenon where a group collectively agrees on a course of action that goes against the preferences or beliefs of each individual in the group. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29cqgzhjcyvzp15e6n26698))
- A sort of step-child of “groupthink”, the Abilene Paradox happens in a *low-energy* collaboration because individuals don't want to express their true feelings or ideas and instead go along with the group to avoid conflict or maintain harmony. As a result, the group ends up making a suboptimal decision that no one actually wanted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29cpzek4e4b4qnxcf1zkezj))
- **Five Strategies to Combat the Abilene Paradox:**
  1. encourage and model open and honest communication among group members
  2. insure leaders or facilitators L.A.V.A. (listen, acknowledge, validate, actively)
  3. establish clear goals and objectives and keep those as flags in the ground
  4. be willing to revisit decisions
  5. default to being open to alternatives that contradict group decisions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29cq8wybxxtsjqp6y7bqcvh))
- Parkinson’s Law is the adage that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29cqn4qex0psjzrf587arqg))
- Any time there’s a project, task, meeting, or communication, default to a clear and present end-time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29cqtjysk8hn6njwyw3xfab))
- It’s critical for the rebels and pioneers among us who, let’s face it, might burn something down because it, at first, doesn’t appear useful.
  The concept goes like this: take a longer term collaboration, where your forebears have erected some policy, practice, code of conduct, whatever, and the next-gen comes along, sees limited use, and takes it down to build a new, more context-appropriate ‘thing.’
  The idea is that before you attempt to change or remove something (i.e., “the fence), you should first understand why it exists in the first place. This can include understanding the history, the stakeholders involved, the intended goals, and any unforeseen consequences or unintended benefits that may have emerged over time.

- Key Strategy to Avoid this Pitfall: Before a significant change is undertaken, use the “Five Why’s” to determine why the thing to be changed was set up in the first place. This will help drill down to some non-obvious deeper cues about the item in question. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h29crkrxb9aeb4s87cazdpap))
