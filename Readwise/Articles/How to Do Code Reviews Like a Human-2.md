## Highlights
- Aim to bring the code up a letter grade or two
  While your teammate might, in *theory*, want to explore every opportunity to improve their code, their patience is finite. They’ll quickly grow frustrated if you withhold approval round after round because you keep thinking of new and brilliant ways for them to polish their changelist.

- The rule of thumb is: if the changelist doesn’t touch the line, it’s out of scope. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1wysq5m111we3znawbjk7f2))
- The author may gripe about splitting the changelist because it’s a tedious task. Ease their burden by identifying logical boundaries for the split. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1wytscajn93h89bv3ryp3qt))
- Grant approval when any of the following are true:
  • You have no more notes.
  • Your remaining notes are for trivial issues.
  • E.g., renaming a variable, fixing a typo
  • Your remaining notes are optional suggestions.
  • Explicitly mark these as optional so that your teammate doesn’t assume your approval is contingent on them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1wywv8y08s3gbr0eysvksfe))
