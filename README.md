## What's 'An Independent Mind' all about?

You may be wondering why this knowledge base is called 'An Independent Mind'.
Well back in the olden days when [Shareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware) was more common,
and when you often had to register your software, there was often a required field for the company you worked out.
But I was just a wee lad, so I didn't have anything to put there.
And so 'An Independent Mind' was born.
